1
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:19,570
and what I'm doing is that I I I just
clean it when very carefully with this

2
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:29,110
cloth and then when i get the the worst
of the wetness out that I start a new

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:37,570
procedure to dry out to help it to draw
out quickly and not drawing like this I

4
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:45,250
the reason is because if you could see
this in the electromagnetic scope then

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:52,090
you will see huge black mountains
turning from black and then when you

6
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:59,920
blow the bomb it looks like dark copper
so you don't want you don't want to

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,750
destroy the upper layer all those small
moments and then when this plate is

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:16,570
driving which is the case now you take a
new container

9
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:35,570
and just a small amount of estimated
water

10
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:57,800
the reason is because desolated water is
smoother than salt water and the reason

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:08,060
for this procedure is because you don't
want the amount of caustic soda to

12
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:17,390
interfere too much with the operation
from the number of field get thing its

13
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:25,070 
secret marriage with the with a metal


14
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,719
when you can see not boiling reactions

15
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:55,870
it's getting clearer and make sure that
the whole surface as a full amount of

16
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:04,420
the selected water it has to dry because
you don't want to take the water

17
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,420
molecules from the disconnected water
into the saltwater

18
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,150
this is a practical a little thing too
long

19
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,510
that's when you attach the Copperfield
you press it like this

20
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:32,180
why because then you are sure that the
connections are connection then i

21
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,180
connect the the plate
