隔夜的果酱

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,590
希望你别觉得尴尬  珍
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,670
我发现  对待新员工最好的办法
but I found the best thing to do with the new employee

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,790
就是用眼神打量他们
is to size them up with a long hard stare.

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,850
-那么  -怎样
- So! - So.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,180
-第一天上班  -没错
- First day! - Yes!

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,630
-害怕吧  -对
- Scary...? - Yes...

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,940
-别怕  -其实我也不是很怕
- Don't be scared! - Oh I'm not really scared.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,530
应该怕
You should be!

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,650
-人家确实有点怕怕啦  -啥  别怕
- Well I'm a little bit scared. - What? Don't be!

19
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,740
你到底想怎样
Make up your mind!

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,690
好吧  你说
So here you are!

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,920
其实  我希望能干些...
Yes. I'm... really looking forward to... getting to grips with the...

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,650
我决定把你安排在I.T.部门
I'm gonna put you in I.T.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,920
因为简历里提到
Because you said on your

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,020
你在电脑方面颇有经验
CV you had a lot of experience with computers.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,370
是有提过啦
I did say that on my CV yes.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,380
我在电脑...  方面的经验确实比较丰富
I have lots of experience with the whole...computer... thing

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,210
神马电子邮件啦
you know, e-mails...

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,220
发邮件  收邮件  删邮件
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails, deleting e-mails...

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,660
-还有很多  -说
- ... I could go on. - Do!

30
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,950
我会上网  会点鼠标  各种鼠标
The Web... Using mouse... mices... using mice.

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,630
单击  双击
Clicking... double clicking...

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,020
当然还会开显示器  打字
the computer screen of course, the keyboard...

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,340
还有那地上的那啥...
the...bit that goes on the floor down there...

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,860
-硬盘吗  -就是它
- The hard drive? - Correct.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,560
看来  你还真是这方面的专家啊
Well, you certainly seem to know your stuff.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,410
就这么定了  我看好你哟
That settles. Got a good feeling about you Jen!

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,120
那边正好缺个主管
And they need a new manager.

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,150
太好了
Oh fantastic!

39
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,440
我的同事怎么样
So... the people I'll be working with, what're they like?

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,050
标准的书呆子
Standard nerds!

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,320
你好  I.T.部
Hello I.T.?

42
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,930
重启过没
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

43
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,920
边上的钮亮不亮
OK, well, the button on the side, is it glowing?

44
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,570
好吧  你得先开机
Yeah, you need to turn it on!

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,730
就按那个钮
The button, turns it on?!

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,990
没错  你...
Yeah... You... Yeah...

47
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,100
不是吧  不会按
You do know how a button works, don't you?

48
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,800
不是  不是衣服上的
No, not on clothes!

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,950
你好  I.T.部
Hello, I.T.?

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,970
是嘛
Yeah?

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,310
有没有试过强制重启
Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,950
不  就是这样  我听见声了
No, no! There you go! No there you go, I just heard it come on.

53
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,880
不不  是开机音乐
No no, that's the music you hear when it comes on.

54
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,550
不  有音乐说明...
No, that's the music you hear when...

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,980
妈的  你从侏罗纪来的啊
I'm sorry, are you from the past?!

56
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,950
驱动程序通过修补
See the driver hooks a

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,210
系统调用表调用挂钩函数
function by patching the system call table.

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,550
所以直接卸载不安全
So it's not safe to unload it,

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,200
除非让另一个进程接管
unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff.

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,350
如果在无效内存中挂掉就悲催了
... and you don't want to end up in middle of invalid memory.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,630
人呢
Hello?

62
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,230
是嘛  有本事过来单挑
Oh really? Really, why don't you come down here and make me then?

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,150
你算毛  你爸是李刚啊
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you!

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,800
有种下来  随时恭候
You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for ya!

65
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,370
丫的欠吼
That told her!

66
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,560
我去  你好错过好戏了
Oh God, it's about time you got back, it's been all go.

67
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,470
你接活了
You had a job?

68
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,230
五楼那姑娘
Girl on fifth...

69
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,280
你跟她...  投缘吗
Did you and her... hit it off?

70
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,910
啥叫"投缘"
Define "Hit it off"?

71
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,920
修完电脑后  她还理你吗
Did she continue talking to you once you'd fixed her computer?

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,130
不理
No...

73
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,770
我修电脑时  她还在我背上放了个杯子
And while I was working on it, she rested a cup on my back.

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,530
-不了个是吧  -你看
- No?! - Yep!

75
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,870
这货不是人
Unbelievable!

76
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
没错  楼上的对咱们太"没"尊重了
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us up there,

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,900
"不"尊重  咬文嚼字最讨厌了
no respect whatsoever!

78
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,760
简直当咱是"浓明公"啊
We're all just drudgens to them

79
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,460
没错
Yes!

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,490
虽然没有"浓明公"这个词
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,030
不过意思差不多
that is what we'd be to them.

82
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,160
打印机坏了的时候
It's like they're pally-wally

83
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,800
一个个都跟孙子似的敬着你
when there's a problem with their printer

84
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,100
只要一修好
but once it's fixed...

85
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,800
就像对待隔夜的果酱  把咱甩了
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,120
没错  隔夜的果酱  太形象了
Yes! Yesterday's jam! That is what we are to them!

87
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,850
其实有点不恰当
Actually you know what? That doesn't really work as a thing...

88
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,250
果酱保质期很长的
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,780
你好  I.T.部
Hello, I.T. ?

90
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,900
重启过没
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

91
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,750
男女混用卫生间
Unisex toilets?

92
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
你们居然有男女混用卫生间
You have unisex toilets,

93
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,340
跟《甜心俏佳人》里一样
like Ally McBeal?

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,290
珍  这里就是那种
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,650
美人不干活  天天搞外遇的地方
A lot of sexy people not doing much work... and having affairs.

96
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,290
天呐  看这风景
Oh my God! Look at that view!

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,520
我仿佛置身世界之巅
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

98
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,300
好了珍  我就送你到这儿
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,880
34层
Floor 34.

100
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,040
太棒了  谢谢  我要去哪层
Great sir, thank you. OK. Where am I going?

101
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,890
一路直下...  地下室
All... the way down to the basement.

102
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,710
好运
Good luck!

103
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:27,460
请离开电梯
Get out of the lift...

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,260
-没拉完呢  -额滴神呐
- Oh. Won't be a tick! - Oh my God!

105
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,920
爹呀  娘呀  晃瞎了我的眼呐
Oh my God! Oh God! OK.

106
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
有人吗
Hello?

107
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,020
有人在吗
Hello?

108
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,100
没错  托尔斯泰曾经曰过...
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...

109
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,410
哟  有客至
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,980
抱歉  方才吾与莫里斯就书籍
I'm sorry, myself and Morris were just engaged

111
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,560
等问题进行了深入探讨
in quite a serious discussion about books and such.

112
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,440
没听见汝来
We didn't hear you come in.

113
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,600
等等  你刚说托尔斯泰  他说啥了
Wait a second, you said it was Tolstoy, he said what?

114
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,460
现在勿言介个  莫里斯
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

115
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,240
你什么时候读过托尔斯泰的书
When have you read Tolstoy?

116
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,700
闭嘴  莫里斯
Shut up, Morris!

117
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,430
你干嘛不说人话
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

118
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,210
什么时候...  我完全不记得聊过这些
When did... I don't remember this conversation at all!

119
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,800
别... 你们继续  我不打搅了
Don't... don't let me disturb you,

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,440
我只是下来...
I just wanted to come down....

121
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,020
别傻了  你哪会打...
Don't be silly you never dist...

122
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,850
很多人都喜欢下来串门
Many people come down here to visit!

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,740
啥  谁会下来  什么人
What are you talking about? Who comes down? What people?

124
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,450
你干嘛暗示我闭嘴
Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?!

125
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,960
我们能”做你什么"[语序说倒了]
So... What can we do you for?

126
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,110
我是这个部门的新主管
I'm the new head of this department.

127
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,890
这是我的办公室吗
Is this my office?

128
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,040
纳尼  她刚刚是不是说...
Why? What did she... Did she just say...

129
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,240
-我才是主管  -我以为是我
- I am the head of this department! - I thought I was.

130
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,070
反正不是你就是我  绝不是她
It's one of us! Certainly not her!

131
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,270
我去找她说清楚
I'm gonna sort this out...

132
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,820
罗伊  你的脑袋破了  破啦
Roy! You've got a head wound there... Head wound!

133
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,420
你好
Hi!

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,430
不是我冒犯
I don't wanna be rude or anything

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,860
但我没收到任何人事变动通知
but I wasn't informed of any changes to this department.

136
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,000
他们没跟你提起我吗
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

137
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,630
没有
No!

138
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,190
我俩在这挺好  多谢关照
And we are perfectly fine down here, thank you very much,

139
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,610
不需要第三者盯梢
we're more than capable of taking care of ourselves.

140
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,640
当然  当然
Sure... sure...

141
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,250
你知道自己在流血吧
You know you're covered in blood?

142
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,730
莫斯
Moss!

143
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,800
淘宝的快递
Amazon thingy.

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,260
太好了
Ah! Wicked!

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,890
我知道是啥东西  最新的《哈利·波特》
I know what this is. It's the new Harry Potter.

146
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,850
我买了一本儿童版一本成人版
I got the child edition and the adult edition

147
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,980
想看看内容有啥区别
just to check that there are no differences in the text.

148
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,170
抱歉  我搞不定那娘们
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able to deal with that woman!

149
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,280
没人接电话吗  我来接
Is nobody else going to get the phone? I suppose I'll get it!

150
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,010
好吧  拿错了  我要躺一会儿
No, that is not a phone. I'm gonna have a little lie down.

151
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,370
请进
Come in!

152
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,110
是的  丹农  是  是
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

153
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,930
没...  他们表现都挺好的
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

154
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,880
是的  我们会相处的很融洽
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,790
嗯  我知道
Yeah, I know.

156
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
那先这样  多保重
All right then, now you take care.

157
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,930
好的  明白
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

158
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,440
好的
Ok!

159
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,750
好的  保重  保重
Ok, take care, take care!

160
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,420
好的  拜拜  拜拜
Ok bye! Bye!

161
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,480
你好
Oh, so, hello!

162
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,940
我能做你...  我能为你做点什么
What can I do you fo... What can I do for you?

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,670
你好  我刚才在想
Hello. I was just wondering...

164
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,440
你需要我帮你接电话线吗
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

165
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,980
不不不  不用
No no no... No.

166
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,880
电话能用  我刚刚才跟丹农通过电话
It's working. I was just talking to Denholm.

167
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,340
这也能打
But how?!

168
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,550
你不介意...  你不介意帮我关门吧
Oh do you mind... Do you mind closing the door for me?

169
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,900
当然  没问题
Oh yeah, sure.

170
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,780
请从外面关
Yeah. From the other side...

171
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,630
好吧
Of course.

172
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,870
-像这样吗  -没错
- Like this? - That's it!

173
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,640
-我站在...  -多谢
- With me on the... - Thanks!

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,310
你没事吧
Are you all right?

175
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,760
没事  莫斯  还没死
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

176
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,580
护士说我没什么大碍
The nurse said I didn't do myself any serious damage.

177
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,820
我站在这儿呢
I'm standing over here!

178
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,360
我知道  开个玩笑  我没事
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

179
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,590
该怎么对付她
What we gonna do about her?

180
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,470
我刚才进去  她居然假装打电话
Well, I just went in, and she was having a pretend conversation.

181
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,030
-真的吗  -没错
- Really? - Yes.

182
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,610
反正  她有点脑残
She's a little bit weird... to say the least.

183
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,790
那是神马
What's that?

184
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,170
水  有时我耳朵会发热
Oh just water. Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

185
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,630
要降降温
and this helps cool it down.

186
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,750
她真是个怪胎
She is quite the oddbod...

187
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,660
你注意到没  她看到这台ZX-IT一代
Did you notice how she didn't even get excited

188
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,520
一点反映都没有
when she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

189
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,460
就是  她脑残
Yeah, that was weird.

190
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,870
好像一点也不懂电脑
It's almost as if she doesn't know anything about computers.

191
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,710
啥
What?!

192
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,310
你干嘛
Look what you did!

193
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,830
没关系  我泡茶总是泡两杯
Oh don't worry that's why I always make 2 cups of tea.

194
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,520
对了  刚才说到哪了
Anyway, what were we talking about?

195
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,490
说她不懂电脑
Oh, her not knowing anything about computers.

196
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,230
啥
What?!

197
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,990
我一定要把她赶走
I definitely want to get rid of her.

198
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,420
同意
I agree yeah.

199
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,640
计划是这样的
Ok, so, here's the plan:

200
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,850
还有计划  先等我戴上大号眼镜
A plan? Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.

201
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,300
好了  说吧
Ok, hit me!

202
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,650
-好  我们进去  -神马时候
- Ok. We go in... - When?

203
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,470
再等一分钟
You know, like in a minute.

204
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,800
一分钟能说完吗
Will that be enough time for me to get to know the plan?

205
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,430
好吧  其实也算不上什么计划
Yeah, you know what? I shouldn't have used the word "Plan"!

206
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,620
害你小激动了
I... I've clearly gotten you over-excited!

207
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,530
明明是大激动好吧
Would "steamed" be a better word?

208
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,580
反正都是兴奋  我还是用这副吧
Although that's just as exciting, I might even use these.

209
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,570
我只是想说...
All I was gonna say was...

210
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,090
进去之后  我扯几句术语
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks about computers

211
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,580
看她听不听得懂
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

212
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,440
难怪你说"算不上计划"
Yes. I can see why you didn't want to use the word "Plan".

213
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,760
让我跟她说
Let me do the talk.

214
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,440
好吧
All right.

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,390
莫斯
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

216
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,130
我们得给力啊
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

217
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,390
要淡定
We... we need to stay calm.

218
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,930
不打无准备之仗
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

219
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,550
等等  筒子们
Hang on, guys.

220
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,420
找我有什么事
How can I help?

221
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,260
既然你已经是我们的主管了
Well, we were just wondering now that you're "The Boss",

222
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,540
需要我们去数据中心
would you like us to access the data supplier

223
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,930
帮你接入公司网络中间件吗
and connect you up to the matrix?

224
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,460
你们故意的是吧
You just made all that up?

225
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,980
你根本不懂电脑  招了吧
You don't know anything about computers, admit it!

226
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,040
别跟我耍花招  快滚回去
Will you stop trying to undermine me! Now get in there,

227
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,860
给我老老实实搞电脑去
and do some work, to do with computers!

228
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,020
我一分钟后去检查
I'll be in there in a minute and check up on you!

229
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,350
行啊  小娘们
Ok, lady!

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,750
算你狠  君子报仇十年不晚
You've won this round, but we can wait!

231
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,990
你总有一天会露馅
You will slip up one day,

232
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,510
我们走着瞧
and believe you me, we will be there when you do!

233
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,560
总有证据能证明
There will be some piece of evidence that will prove

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,700
你是个毫无疑问的
without any shadow of a doubt

235
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,560
电脑大白痴
that you don't know anything about computers.

236
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,730
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

237
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,620
给你的电脑插电
Plugging in your computer.

238
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,690
不管你说什么  做什么
It might be something you say... or something you do!

239
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,710
总会露出马脚的  最好别被我们逮着
But when we notice this, and believe me we will notice this,

240
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,310
否则你会死的很惨  小妞
there's gonna be a long way down for you, sweet chicks!

241
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,210
他马上就会反应过来...
He'll realise in a second...

242
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,490
真不敢相信  你们居然来打小报告
I cannot believe you're going to tell on me.

243
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,110
你俩就像老巫婆
You're like a pair of horrible old women.

244
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,620
她说啥
What did she say?

245
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,240
她说我们像老巫婆
She said we're like horrible old women.

246
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,520
不了个是吧
She didn't!

247
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,400
你们好
Hey guys!

248
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
找我有事吗
Ok, got something to tell me?

249
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,580
是这样的
Yes, well, it's like this:

250
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,040
看看你们  我的I.T.团队
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

251
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,420
-没错  -你们每个人都是团队的一员
- Yeah. - Team players each and every one of you.

252
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,430
但她...
Yeah, what she...

253
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,970
在我这儿没有团队精神可不行
There's no room for people who can't act in a team on my team!

254
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,510
抱歉
Excuse me.

255
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,860
喂
Hello?

256
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,170
什么
What?!

257
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,910
你们如果不能团队合作就给我走人
Well if you can't work as a team, you're all fired!

258
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,740
没听错  你们被解雇了  
That's it, you heard me, fine!

259
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,680
收拾东西走人
Get your things and go!

260
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,410
喂  保卫科吗
Hello, Security?

261
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,520
四楼的人都被炒了
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

262
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,270
把他们从大楼里轰出去
Escort them from the premises.

263
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,390
别忘了团队合作
And do it as a team!

264
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,440
记住你们是个团队
Remember you're a team,

265
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,410
如果没有团队精神也给我走人
and if you can't act as a team, you're fired too!

266
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,570
道恩
Dawn!

267
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,400
找人事部  让他们招一组
Get onto recruitment. Tell them to look for a security team

268
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,380
有团队精神的保安队
that can work as team.

269
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,260
让他们把现在的保安队轰出去
They may have to escort our security team from the building,

270
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,570
他们没有团队精神
for not acting like a team!

271
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,630
团队  团队  团队
Team! Team team team team team!

272
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,690
我特喜欢说这个词
I even love saying the word "Team".

273
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,880
你们可能认为这是我的全家福
You probably think that's a picture of my family?

274
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,830
这是顶级团队
It's the A-Team.

275
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,590
宝迪  道尔  泰格  和珠宝男
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

276
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,150
都是精英
All of them!

277
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,990
话说你们来找我干嘛
So what do you wanna tell me?

278
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,610
我们合不来
Well, it's just not working out.

279
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
-他开玩笑的  -但你说...
- He's joking! - But you said...

280
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,570
合不来
Not working out?

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,300
不  不
Oh no! No!

282
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,730
我们好似干柴烈火
We are getting on like a big house on fire!

283
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,580
-没错  -我的耳朵烫死了
- Yeah! - My ear's getting hot!

284
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,400
看来我们该走了  因为...
No... You know what? We should leave, now, because

285
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,860
你是个大忙人
you know, you're a busy man

286
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,890
抱歉  占了你很多时间
and we've taken far too much of your time.

287
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,700
珍你能帮我开门吗
Jen could you just get the door for me there?

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,760
当然  罗伊
Absolutely Roy!

289
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,520
那你们来干嘛
So why did you come here in the first place?

290
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,020
我们给你电脑装了个语言激活系统
We set up a voice activation system on your computer.

291
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
我觉得你会喜欢的
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

292
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,710
不过可能要花点时间
It might just take a little

293
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,350
做识别训练
while to get the pitch right on the voice

294
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,500
别着急  多跟它说说话  非常感谢
but nonetheless, go ahead! Thank you very much!

295
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,600
-拜拜  -谢谢
- Bye bye! - Thank you!

296
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,050
太激动了
How exciting!

297
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,560
你好
Hello...

298
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,140
电脑你好
Hello computer!

299
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,240
你好
Hello!

300
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,840
你好  电脑你好
Hello... Hello computer...

301
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,530
你到底会什么
What good are you?

302
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,150
你绝对是个电脑大菜鸟
You obviously don't know anything about computers.

303
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,550
好吧
No but... OK.

304
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,940
但我可以学嘛
But I can learn.

305
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,070
比如  莫斯
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

306
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,240
跟我说说你在干嘛
you could take me through what you're doing right now.

307
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,470
非常乐意
I'd be delighted!

308
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,640
我在写一段十分简单的程序代码
I'm just working on a very simple piece of programming code.

309
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,240
原来如此...
I see...

310
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,180
好吧  我又扯犊子了  压根没听懂
Oh God, no, I'm lying again! I didn't understand any of that!

311
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,480
我对电脑一窍不通...
I don't know anything about computers, I mean...

312
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,370
来这只能打酱油
I'm absolutely useless to you.

313
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,580
我还是打包回家算了
I might as well pack up and go home.

314
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,440
你好  请问罗伊在吗
Hi! Is... Roy around?

315
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,620
你好啊  小姑娘
Hello there little lady!

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,180
迷路了吗  要我带路吗  我是罗伊
Are you lost? How can I help you? I'm Roy.

317
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,000
让老娘下来是吧
You wanted me to come down?!

318
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,170
老娘我来了
Well here I am!!

319
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,570
别踹脸
Not the face!!

320
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,620
别踹脸
Not the face!!

321
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,140
老娘来教教你
Well maybe this will teach you

322
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,700
待人的基本礼貌
to treat people with a little bit of respect!

323
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,890
难道是因为之前的那通电话
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone earlier?

324
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,580
俺的婶啊  这是莫罗的吗
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

325
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,580
莫罗：英国品牌，高跟鞋中的"贵族"

326
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,240
是啊
Yes!

327
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,040
真漂亮  贵吗
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

328
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,290
不贵  我趁打折买的
No, no no no! Got them in a sale.

329
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,610
真是精明啊
Oh God! Clever you!

330
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,540
我怎么就没赶上呢
I'm never lucky enough to get a bargain myself.

331
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,110
下次带你去
Well, I should take you shopping.

332
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,070
太好了
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

333
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,220
到时候给你电话  
Oh I will give you a call.

334
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,540
再见  走好
Nice to meet you! Take care!

335
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,130
-再也别见了  -果然是老大
- Nice meeting you! - Chairman! Wow!

336
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,670
几句话就把那老女人搞定了
You just diffuse that entire situation!

337
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,960
什么老女人
What situation?

338
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,270
你说这个啊...  他经常被打吗
Oh oh, that.. yeah! Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

339
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,420
已经见怪不怪了
They're fairly regular, the beatings, yes.

340
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,900
每周正常一揍
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

341
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,630
别说的惨兮兮
Ah it's not all that bad!

342
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,360
认了吧罗伊  就是这么惨
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

343
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,680
这我也许能帮上忙
Maybe I could help with this. You know, I mean...

344
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,020
我善于交际
I'm a people person and...

345
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,710
你们需要找个人帮忙搞外交
people like you need a person to deal with people...

346
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,390
比如我这种
a people person like me. Oh my God!

347
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,280
有主意了  大脑开动了
Ideas are coming! Things are happening here!

348
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,340
你们看这样如何
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

349
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,660
如果我有个计划
if I told you that I had a plan

350
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,720
可以把你们在楼上的形象提升一倍  如何
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%. What would you say?

351
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,720
太假了  做梦
I can't be done! You're crazy!

352
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,070
罗伊你说呢  
What would you say Roy?

353
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,490
罗伊昏过去了  很好
Roy's passed out! Ok!

354
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,970
我需要一支记号笔  和几张纸
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

355
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,310
派对  I.T.部  今晚5点45分

356
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,330

357
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,370
是真的
Oh no, really really really, that was a true story!

358
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,810
真是难以置信
Unbelievable!

359
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,890
以前咋没跟你们出去玩呢
I said why we don't go out with the I.T. Guys more often?

360
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,220
-你们太欢乐了  -必须的
- You're hilarious! - Yes we are!

361
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,670
你们应该多下来溜达溜达
You guys should come down here more often you know,

362
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,370
把这当成瑞农公司的新天地
you should see this as a new era for Reynholm Industries.

363
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,260
"瑞农公司的新天地"
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

364
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,740
有件非常非常有趣的事哦
Oh Do you know what! If you want to hear something really funny,

365
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,900
想听吗想听吗
a really funny story,

366
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,600
猜猜我和莫斯经历了什么
you should hear what happened to Moss and I,

367
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,290
有一次我们在阿姆斯特丹喝多了
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

368
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,230
结果莫斯把眼睛弄丢了
that Moss lost his glasses!

369
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,460
莫斯  莫斯
Moss! Moss!

370
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,060
快过来  快过来
Come here! Come here!

371
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,970
跟他们讲讲喝醉后发生了什么
Tell them that story about when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,650
你确定
Really?

373
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,250
必须的
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

374
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,090
太给力了  你们肯定要笑到喷
Oh this a great story, you're gonna love it!

375
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,940
我再去开箱酒
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

376
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,310
说吧
Well go on, then.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,210
好吧
All right.

378
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,360
-有天晚上  我们喝多了  -然后呢
- Well, one night, we were really drunk. - Yeah.

379
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,460
我们醉到不行
And huh, we were so drunk

380
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,770
于是决定找鸡
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

381
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,950
可开房之后
And when they arrived to the hotel,

382
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,550
我们什么都不敢做
we were too scared to do anything,

383
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,330
于是带她们去了游乐场
so we brought them to the fair.

384
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,110
最后她们只收了我们一半的钱
Oh really nice! In the end, they only charged us half.

385
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,240
但交通费都是我们出的
But we did have to pay for all the rides.

386
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,530
怎么样  故事给力吧
Oh isn't that just the best story?

387
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,170
哦  伙计
Oh, man!

388
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,630
你不是让我永远别提那事的嘛
You told me to never tell that story to anyone.

389
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,910
你说啥呢  那故事多给力啊
Well, what're you talking about? That's a brilliant story!

390
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,560
后来你差点走沟里去
And then you nearly walked into the canal!

391
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,420
船夫那段你提了吗
Has it got to that part with the boatman?

392
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,220
你说的是我丢眼镜那事啊
Do you mean the story when I lost my glasses?

393
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,250
是啊
Yes!

394
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,970
你以为我指的是什么
What story did you think I mean?

395
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,970
莫斯
Moss?

396
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,750
你说什么了  你说什么了
What did you say?! What did you say?!

397
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,510
你们是没什么损失啦
It's all right for you two.

398
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,000
反正你们形象早就毁了
You're used to being social piranhas...

399
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,340
但通常我人气很高的
I'm a very popular person usually.

400
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,280
早上用鞋扁我那姑娘
That girl earlier, that tried to beat me to death with her shoes,

401
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,340
有她号码吗
did anybody get her number?

402
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,790
其实游乐场那天挺欢乐的
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

403
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,600
跟小布和晶晶一起
With Brandy and Crystal!

404
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,250
你好  I.T.部
Hello I.T.?

405
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,620
重启过没
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off and on again?

406
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,870
你好  你好
Hello ! Hello !
