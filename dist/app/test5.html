Sass
URL
1. well hello internet and welcome to my
2. sauce video tutorial in this tutorial to
3. show you all the cool things we can do
4. with sass as well as compass which is a
5. framework that is built on top of sass
6. and I have a whole lot to do so let's
7. get into it so you may ask yourself why
8. would we ever want to use sass well it's
9. basically going to allow us to write
10. more maintainable code faster now with
11. CSS you're normally going to be
12. targeting individual elements and then
13. styling those elements and the problem
14. with that is if you use the same
15. properties for multiple elements you're
16. going to have to type those properties
17. in over and over and over again
18. well sass is going to provide us with
19. variables and functions and a whole
20. bunch of other things that are going to
21. instead going to allow us to reuse those
22. properties that we're defining so for
23. example if we would just deal with color
24. what we would have here is let's say we
25. have e f de CD and this is very ugly
26. what sass is going to allow us to do
27. instead is to define a variable called
28. almond which represents this color and
29. then we would just type in this guy
30. right here and what that's going to
31. allow us to do is then anytime we want
32. to define our color we could instead
33. just type in almond which is very very
34. useful and this is how easy it is to
35. define variables inside of sass and
36. you're going to see much more of this as
37. the tutorial continues the thing that's
38. really cool is we're going to be able to
39. define a property once with a logical
40. name like you saw there with almond and
41. then reuse it over and over and over
42. again and what's also awesome about that
43. is we're going to be able to find that
44. logical name once and then use it
45. document wide and it's also going to be
46. very easy to change because it's going
47. to be located in one place another thing
48. that's great about sass is compass which
49. like I said before it's a framework
50. that's built on sass it's going to allow
51. us to automatically generate properties
52. create cross-browser CSS and a whole
53. bunch of other different things as
54. you'll see for example if you wanted to
55. define a y translation as well as a
56. scale on one of your objects or elements
57. in CSS you would have to type all of
58. this out instead with sass and compass
59. we could instead just go include and
60. then transform and then translate why
61. 50% and scale by 1/2 throw that guy
62. side of their and compass is going to
63. automatically generate all this stuff
64. for you so that will work cross-browser
65. however you can see that this is much
66. more neat and tidy another thing that's
67. really cool about sass is we're going to
68. be able to use nesting rules for
69. different states so instead of typing
70. out this and dividing everything up
71. we're instead going to be able to come
72. in here and go horizontal nav and then
73. go for our link define our color for the
74. static link and then inside of here put
75. an and colon and hover and define our
76. color change whenever our link is
77. hovered over and we could throw almond
78. in there as well well since it's a
79. variable however we're going to type in
80. almond just like that so that's another
81. neat thing that we're going to be able
82. to use to organize our code and SAS is
83. also going to be able to automatically
84. for us compress all our code so our page
85. is load quicker it's also going to make
86. it easy to optimize for many different
87. screen sizes and in this tutorial I'm
88. going to focus in on the extension s CSS
89. version of SAS so when we jump over and
90. show you exactly how we're going to
91. install this now SAS is going to be used
92. with rails so that's the reason why it's
93. in my rails tutorial if you're wondering
94. why it's inside of there and that's
95. going to mean that you're going to need
96. to have rails automatically installed
97. inside of here for all this stuff to
98. work and in the description on the link
99. to my tutorial and exactly how to
100. install rails it's very very easy as a
101. website to basically walk you through
102. the whole entire process now after you
103. have all that setup let's make sure that
104. we have the proper versions of rails and
105. Ruby installed on our system and this is
106. what you're going to type into your
107. computer and your terminal it doesn't
108. matter if you are on Windows or if you
109. are on OSX or Linux or whatever and then
110. I'm going to go Jim update no - or doc
111. this is going to update all of our gems
112. just to make sure that we have
113. everything all exactly the same and then
114. we can type in Ruby - V and you're going
115. to see that we have Ruby 2.2 which is
116. great and rails - V and we have rails
117. setup as well now what you're going to
118. want to do is install compass and
119. compass requires sass so it's going to
120. automatically install it and your
121. Jim install compass you might have to
122. type sudo inside of there you can see
123. there it goes got it and everything is
124. all installed now we'll be able to go to
125. SAS - V and we see that we have SAS
126. installed and compass - V and we see
127. that we have compass installed alright
128. now that we have everything installed
129. exactly how hard is it going to be for
130. us to create a project where we're just
131. going to type in compass create and then
132. I'm going to call this test one whatever
133. you want to call yours and there you go
134. and it's going to automatically generate
135. Aang for you I'm going to type in well
136. let's clear this LS and there's test one
137. we're going to change our directory to
138. test one and you can see everything here
139. is installed if I want to open up all
140. this in sublime I'm just going to type
141. in su BL and a dot and there it's going
142. to go and it's going to open up
143. everything that I need now let's go
144. through here and actually take a look at
145. what we got so the first thing we got
146. here is config dot RB it's very
147. important let's open it up and go
148. through exactly what we have here this
149. basically has all of our configuration
150. two faults plugins how CSS should be
151. generated and two what directory here
152. you can see all of the different
153. directories we're going to be storing
154. all our stuff in so we have our CSS
155. directory or sass directory our images
156. directory and our Java scripts directory
157. this HTTP path right here could be
158. either be a forward slash for you or it
159. could have two dots preceding it mine
160. actually has two dots so you can
161. experiment with that a little bit down
162. here you can see our output style and we
163. have a couple different options here
164. nested is going to use indents when
165. defining nested styles we already took a
166. look at nesting compact is going to put
167. all of your CSS code on a single line
168. instead of using a different line for
169. each one of the properties when they're
170. defined and compressed is what we're
171. going to use when we're ready to get
172. live and this is going to remove
173. comments as well as whitespace
174. I accidentally skipped this guy up here
175. where we have our plugins if you're
176. going to want to use a plug-in you're
177. just going to type in require and then
178. whatever your plug-in name is like for
179. example sussy is a plug-in which I'll
180. probably cover in the next
181. toriel if you'd like to see that which
182. is allowing us to use grid systems
183. inside of here which is very useful as
184. well this guy down here if uncommented
185. is going to allow to use a helper
186. function to point to your images folder
187. which we define right here and I'll get
188. more into that a little bit this guy
189. down here if active will display
190. comments that are going to point to the
191. sass source for your CSS and that is
192. basically everything you need to know
193. about the config dot RB file now there's
194. other ways to come in here and create
195. projects we could also come in here and
196. be very very specific and we go compass
197. create and if you wanted to define your
198. sass directory like say sass like this
199. and then you want to give specific names
200. as basically what it is and this would
201. be e CSS and then your JavaScript
202. directory this would only be used if you
203. didn't want to use the default Java
204. scripts dir and let's just say we went
205. in at the BJS
206. and then to stay here on one line if you
207. also wanted to define your images
208. directory you could do it just like that
209. and that's all you need to type in and
210. hit enter and compass would go in and
211. create your projects with your very
212. specific folder names but for this one
213. I'm just going to stick with what we
214. have right here might as well go in here
215. and this is basically what everything's
216. going to work here are going to be all
217. your sass file C F CSS and this is where
218. you're going to be putting those in and
219. here is going to be the style sheets
220. that are going to be automatically
221. generated for you based off of the code
222. you write up here so like we saw before
223. whenever we wanted to generate
224. cross-browser CSS and we wanted compass
225. to do that for us well we would define
226. what we would have up here in very
227. simple formats and then compass will
228. generate the complex cross browser code
229. down here okay so now what I'm going to
230. do is create a bunch of partial files
231. that are going to allow us to split up
232. our CSS and what's really cool about
233. sass is it's going to allow us to split
234. it up while at the same times not
235. require multiple HTTP requests for each
236. part so we're just going to go into this
237. guy and then go into sass and we're
238. going to create a new folder and we're
239. going to call it partials and there that
240. is and that's automatically going to
241. show up in sublime text and here we are
242. over in sublime text then there's
243. partials now we're going to create a
244. whole bunch of different files so new
245. file and what
246. gonna call this guy let's file save as
247. and let's call this guy underscore base
248. the underscore is very important and
249. then s CSS and let's save that and let's
250. just create a whole bunch more so create
251. new and then file save as we're gonna
252. have everything here done in the
253. beginning variables which is where we're
254. going to store all a bunch of variables
255. and make sure this is an underscore up
256. here if you can't say underscore and
257. then dot s CSS there was base that was
258. the first one if you didn't see it and
259. then create another partial save as and
260. let's call this guy layout this is
261. normally where you would just just
262. define the layout part of your
263. application I may or may not use that in
264. this tutorial haven't decided yet
265. and newfound what I mean by layout is
266. how the elements layout on the screen
267. and not the properties within them and
268. save as and this guy is going to be
269. mix-ins which are really cold you're
270. gonna see those here in a second
271. and then one more partial file and file
272. save as and this guy is going to be
273. called normalized thought s CSS and save
274. that and here we are so let's go over
275. into base first I'm going to cover
276. something sass comments if you want to
277. make a single line comment this is how
278. you make a single line comment and just
279. know that this may not be rendered after
280. this is turned from an S CSS file into a
281. CSS file and then you have multi-line
282. comments comments and they would end
283. with a star and a closing bracket and we
284. normally put them like this and these
285. guys will definitely show whenever
286. everything is compiled into a CSS file
287. however it may not show where you want
288. if you want to guarantee that it's going
289. to show and it's going to show exactly
290. where you place it you will use what are
291. called loud comments and they come out
292. exactly like this just put an
293. exclamation work and there you go and
294. you can be positive that those will show
295. up now what I want to do is define the
296. normalized part of my application and
297. this is the guy that I'm using I'll put
298. a link in the description as well
299. there's all numerous of these guys out
300. there that you can use you can use
301. whatever you
302. prefer if you already have something but
303. basically if you don't know what this is
304. just a collection of HTML elements and
305. attributes that are going to normalize
306. the styles across all of the browsers
307. and you can just copy this guy right
308. here and then jump over here to
309. normalize s CSS this guy right here and
310. paste that in and save that and you're
311. done with normalize s CSS now I want to
312. go into the variables section and what
313. I'm going to do here is I'm just going
314. to copy and paste in a whole bunch of
315. variables so you can see exactly how
316. those are defined that I'm going to use
317. maybe site-wide and then from this point
318. on I'll be able to just refer to them by
319. their little dollar sign on whatever
320. name I provide for them right here and
321. some people whenever they're naming
322. their variables like naming based off of
323. where the color will be used while
324. others prefer names that represent the
325. color I basically just go with the flow
326. and just do whatever but I do prefer to
327. have variable names that are logical
328. that sound good to me and/or our good
329. representation of whatever color I'm
330. using another thing just to cover pretty
331. much everything you can also define it a
332. fault so let's say we have a default
333. let's call it text color and let's make
334. this black and then put exclamation mark
335. and default and what we're saying here
336. is this is the default that's going to
337. be used only if a value isn't set or
338. signed anyplace else so now that we have
339. all of those set up what are we going to
340. do to make them show up in our
341. stylesheet well we're gonna have to come
342. over and create the Styles part of our
343. style sheet something to come over here
344. to the sass area and just go a new file
345. and I'm gonna save this as file save as
346. Styles dot SC SS and save that and I
347. saved it in the sass directory and I
348. forgot something over here in our
349. terminal what we want to do is first off
350. let's make sure we're in the right
351. directory we are if we want compass to
352. automatically update or create our CSS
353. files every time that we change any of
354. the files in our project in general
355. we're going to do is type in Compass and
356. watch and enter and it's going to go in
357. there and automatically generate all of
358. the files for us and all of the changes
359. that we make you can say that it's going
360. to compile those files and if we jump
361. over here you can now see
362. there if we click on styles dot CSS it
363. is there as well as being up here
364. alright so now that we have that inside
365. of there how we going to import compass
366. for example we're going to say import
367. and then compass got that installed and
368. also we're going to want to import our
369. variables so import and this is in
370. partials and variables and then we're
371. going to import more of these but let's
372. also import partials normalize and now
373. we have everything that we've created so
374. far all inside of our Styles dot s CSS
375. file actually I put them in the wrong
376. one let's cut this out here I stuck them
377. in the Styles dot CSS we want to close
378. that let's just save it and then close
379. it and then go into this guy and paste
380. that in there and file save and there
381. we're ready to go now I'm going to go in
382. here and create my index.html file so
383. just go in here and I'm gonna go and
384. copy and paste in all my index files you
385. can see everything right there it's just
386. all this stuff is going to be available
387. in the description underneath the video
388. I'm going to save this file save as in
389. my main project area as index.html and
390. save that and you can see right here
391. what I have style sheets and styles dot
392. CSS save and now you can see if I load
393. this in the browser here is all of the
394. HTML it's kind of a mess but over the
395. course this tutorial to fix a whole
396. bunch of things I am however going to go
397. in here and paste in some just regular
398. CSS code in my Styles dot s CSS file and
399. I'm going to be adding a whole bunch of
400. other different things but this is just
401. basically a regular old CSS and you can
402. use that of course in s CSS as well
403. without any problems and let's save that
404. and reload it and see how things have
405. changed and there you go you can see
406. that some things are looking good and
407. some things are a little bit of a mess
408. I'm going to jump back over into my
409. project and I'm going to go a new folder
410. and this is going to be called images
411. and remember I didn't automatically
412. generate these but I showed you how that
413. you could and I might as well just come
414. in here and put Java scripts as well
415. Java scripts and of course we want to
416. make sure those are the same as our
417. config file but before we do it's jump
418. in images and paste in some images that
419. I have here for my website and there's
420. the config dot RB file and yes it's
421. called Java score
422. ups and images and this is called images
423. and JavaScript so everything's looking
424. good okay now that I pasted those images
425. in let's reload it and it looks a little
426. bit nicer but we're gonna fix some
427. things off now I'm going to jump over
428. into base s CSS and I'm going to define
429. some defaults that I'm gonna have site
430. wide that weren't covered by the
431. normalized part of my site so I'm going
432. to say something like body and defined
433. font family as well as Arial Helvetica
434. and all these other different things
435. inside of here another thing I want to
436. do is I want to define the text color
437. using what's called a mixin so I'm going
438. to go into my mix in s CSS and mix-ins
439. are basically just functions that we can
440. pass values into and they're going to do
441. certain things for us and how we define
442. one is we go mix in and we can say
443. default text color and we'll just call
444. this TC for text color and then we'll
445. say color is TC right like that another
446. thing you could do is if you wanted to
447. have a default inside of here in case
448. this function was called and nothing was
449. passed inside of it we could do that
450. just like that but for this yeah let's
451. just leave it that way so this is
452. basically just going to allow us to
453. define a color now let's jump back over
454. into the base CSS file and let's use
455. that mixin so if we want to define our
456. color here we're going to say @include
457. default text color which is the name we
458. gave for our function and let's pass in
459. black and what that's gonna do for us is
460. automatically going to spit this guy out
461. with whatever color was passed inside of
462. there exactly right here so it's a nice
463. easy way for us to define some different
464. things that we want and you can do a lot
465. of things with mix-ins as we're gonna
466. see it here in just a moment also would
467. kind of want to come in here I want to
468. put a wrapper it's gonna surround
469. everything let's come in here and fix
470. some of these issues that we see here in
471. our browser in our website and what's
472. happening here is we're having a lot of
473. overlapping issues so what we want to do
474. is we want to make sure that our
475. rendered box elements include the
476. padding and the borders and whatever
477. else and make sure that they fit with
478. the width that we define inside of our
479. website and how we can do that is just
480. go to star and here I'm just going to go
481. WebKit box-sizing and go border-box like
482. I said it's just gonna say if we define
483. a width include the padding and the
484. borders and such with whatever width we
485. define inside of it you're gonna see
486. here in a second what this looks like
487. and box-sizing border box and then
488. finally box-sizing border box another
489. thing I'd like to demonstrate here is
490. nesting again because it's pretty
491. important with sass just want to make
492. sure that you understand it let's say
493. that I specifically want to target all
494. of my link tags inside of here this is
495. inside of an article element all of this
496. stuff inside of here
497. so we're going to say article and these
498. are all inside of P tags just so you
499. know what I'm talking about here we are
500. let's go down here and you can see right
501. here is article and P tags and then the
502. links inside of those P tags that's what
503. I want to focus in on here and a let's
504. say that I want them to have my default
505. blue color and here I'm using a variable
506. of course that if I want them to change
507. to something else on hover
508. I just put and and hover like that and
509. let's say also focus let's do that as
510. well that's how easy that is make sure
511. you put the colon inside of here and
512. then whenever they have hover or focus I
513. want to change the color on those to
514. what I called Duke blue and then I could
515. also change my color once again if it is
516. visited color and let's have this be
517. blue gray and file save that now what I
518. want to do is use all of these styles
519. that I have here over in my Styles SCS
520. file so I'm going to have to come in and
521. import those as well and you're going to
522. see that for example right here how this
523. doesn't line up and all kinds other
524. different things are going to be
525. corrected here in a second say oh that's
526. terrible let's fix that and we already
527. did we just need to import the base and
528. we also need to import the mix in so
529. let's go partials mix-ins
530. and then we want to do the same thing
531. for base so base then we're going to be
532. doing a ton of things with compass using
533. css3 styles and to use them you're going
534. to have to
535. Porthos will say compass dot css3 if
536. I'll save and see some things fixing up
537. look say things started fixing
538. themselves up see it doesn't get all
539. wonky now whenever I do this and the
540. images size well and so forth and so on
541. that all comes from this guy right here
542. if you were wondering that's very very
543. useful if you ever have problems with
544. your stuff not fitting well there you go
545. that's a solution so let's jump back
546. into styles doe-eyed s CSS and this is
547. we're gonna spend the rest of the
548. tutorial and I'm basically just going to
549. walk you through how to change a whole
550. bunch of different things right here on
551. the screen okay so the very first thing
552. I'm going to do is I'm going to be
553. messing around this navigation it's over
554. here so where is that guy here it is
555. it's called vertical navigation sidebar
556. left you can see right there and what
557. I'm going to be doing is focusing in on
558. all of these link tags and I'm going to
559. change their color and I'm also going to
560. change their color based off of hover as
561. well so how do we do that back into
562. Styles let's just go right down here to
563. the bottom so if I want to target that
564. of course just left sidebar and of
565. course this is left sidebar links this
566. guy right here and it's defined as a
567. class and that's good because I want to
568. target a whole bunch of them so sidebar
569. links and what do I want to do here well
570. the a or the links inside of here I want
571. to go display:block just going to make
572. them like block elements so then I want
573. to change them their color to main green
574. and let's say that I want to change
575. their opacity their default opacity to
576. 70% however whenever they are hovered
577. over I want to come in here and go hover
578. and change their opacity in that
579. situation to a hundred percent let's
580. save that and reload this and you can
581. see now there they up see the opacity is
582. changing so that's just another
583. demonstration of nesting inside of here
584. very important that's the reason why I'm
585. covering it a whole bunch of times
586. let's say I also want to put a border
587. underneath of each of these guys except
588. for the last one how exactly what I do
589. that well I would go left sidebar and I
590. normally break these up into more files
591. and just keeping it this way so that
592. pretty much everything's here all in one
593. place so we can go border bottom and
594. let's make this two pixels solid and
595. let's use Maine green again close that
596. off and if I want to put
597. order everywhere except with the last
598. child well I could just go like this
599. and last child and say border:none for
600. that one and reload and you could say
601. everybody has a border underneath of it
602. except for the last child which is right
603. there the thing it's neat to know is you
604. can also nest CSS properties so example
605. let's say I have just example element
606. just do this just to do it I could come
607. in here and save border and then top one
608. pixel solid blue and then do exactly the
609. same thing for the other ones and that
610. will allow you to change those default
611. properties as well that we're not going
612. to use that just one to cover it because
613. it came to mind another thing that's
614. neat is we can extend existing
615. properties so let's say down here we
616. have a riddle it says a dad and his son
617. riding their bikes and crashed and blah
618. blah blah blah blah whatever it doesn't
619. really matter let's say we want to
620. target the riddle part of that down
621. there and here is the riddle it's an ID
622. see there it is right there jump back
623. over here what we're going to do here is
624. to find some things and then use it
625. inside of another element so we say 20
626. pixels padding and margin top 10 pixels
627. we can then say riddle answer which is
628. what follows underneath of it and take
629. everything or all the properties defined
630. right here and put them down inside of
631. here and how we do that is go at extend
632. and then riddle and that's going to take
633. all those properties and put them there
634. just as if they were there all along and
635. then we could also good margin talk 10
636. pixels actually for this one I wanted to
637. make this a little different let's make
638. this background color and let's make
639. this Alice blue and reload it and you
640. can see that there it shows up and at
641. the background and the padding were
642. borrowed from Riddle and used in the
643. riddle answer which is right there we
644. could also come in and define properties
645. or create properties just so that we can
646. extend them and that basically just
647. means we would go and put a % and dotted
648. box for example and border and let's say
649. Duke blue so this is only being created
650. so that it can be used by other elements
651. and margin and
652. pixels and zero pixels now what we can
653. do is go to riddle answer again
654. and extend input dotted box inside of
655. there and it's going to take all this
656. properties and add them and there you
657. can see now it has a dotted box around
658. it so that's also neat get into some
659. different properties we can play with
660. let's go with our left sidebar links
661. play around with those and let's call
662. border color and let's say if we want to
663. lighten it we can just go lighten and
664. we're going to pass in Maine green as
665. the color we want to use for our border
666. color and let's say we want to lighten
667. it by 70% we can do that reload and you
668. can see that those got lighter tons of
669. these things packed inside of sass as
670. well as compass and you can do the
671. exactly the same things with darken so
672. just put dark and inside of there
673. instead of lighten so I'll save reload
674. and there you can see it's almost black
675. you could also generate a 180 degree
676. compliment of a color let's open up a
677. website here we are this is an example
678. of what I'm talking about you would be
679. able to change the hue of the color
680. inside of here by moving around inside
681. of this wheel inside here so let's say
682. we want to go search button which is
683. this guy right up here there's your
684. search button and let's say that
685. whenever it's hovered want to change its
686. color background color do the complement
687. of whatever it is so let's have it be
688. main green is the color that I want to
689. work with and now you can see when I
690. hover over it changes to that complement
691. color I'm going to go through a whole
692. bunch of these you could also invert a
693. color so let's just go search button
694. hover play around with this a little bit
695. and adjust my hue again it's going to
696. just the hue of whatever color you pass
697. inside of here so if I have Maine green
698. and I want to change it by 90 degrees to
699. be very specific I can do that it's sort
700. of like a purple now instead of a
701. burgundy color now I'm going to come in
702. here and play around with these guys a
703. lot or vertical navigation so let's jump
704. in here and look at exactly how those
705. are all set up
706. there's our vertical navigation what I'm
707. going to be doing is grabbing the
708. children elements of this vert and Ave
709. that we have right inside of here and of
710. course it's an unordered list and I want
711. to get list items so I'm going to be
712. targeting the child elements of these
713. list items
714. and how we're going to target those is
715. just go vert now unordered list list
716. item the list item I want to target and
717. child and I want to get the first child
718. background color and let's say I want to
719. use desaturate just going through each
720. one of the different types of things you
721. can do here you can see on the right
722. side of the screen how it's going to
723. work and desaturate 80% for the orange
724. that i pass in and you can see exactly
725. how that looks now I'm basically just
726. going to do the same thing using
727. multiple different color change options
728. that are available with SAS so let's say
729. that with the second element inside of
730. that vertical navigation I want to try
731. saturated it saturate just change it
732. like that
733. and I can just leave it be 80 and orange
734. and reload it you can see how that
735. changed somebody that's more of a color
736. expert than I am might be able to do a
737. little bit more but I'm just going
738. through and showing you all the
739. different things that are available and
740. you can play with them on your own you
741. could also define transparencies for
742. these guys by just going in and typing
743. in fade out and there's another one I
744. can't remember it's called like
745. transparent eyes it's the same thing it
746. does exactly the same thing as fade out
747. fade out always made more sense to me so
748. I use fade out let's say I wanted to use
749. orange again but I wanted to do 50% and
750. reload and you can see all that changed
751. they come in here and zoom in it's going
752. to get a little bit wonky but since I'm
753. focusing on on the vertical navigation
754. that doesn't really matter I could also
755. make the color more opaque and for this
756. one I would use fade in and orange that
757. works and let's just have this be 0.8
758. whoops change the first child let's
759. change the fourth child instead we could
760. also define RGB colors inside of here so
761. let's change this to a 5 and this is
762. just going to be a little bit of red a
763. little bit of green a little bit of blue
764. and a little bit of alpha red green blue
765. alpha then we're going to define the
766. amounts that we want for each one of
767. these so let's have this be 0 0 205 for
768. our alpha okay you do really crazy
769. things like mix two colors together and
770. then find the percentage of the first
771. color and how you do that is by typing
772. in mix
773. and then we could do something like
774. yellow is going to be the first color we
775. want to mix together with a white and
776. how much yellow do we want this to be
777. let's have it be 50% and you can see it
778. change right there now it changes to 6
779. so we can keep everything on the screen
780. all at one time
781. there's tons of coloring options I'm
782. showing you a lot of them but not all of
783. them
784. you could also force a color to be
785. grayscale so you pass it a color and you
786. say give me the grayscale version of
787. this color that I give you so let's just
788. come in here like that you could see
789. there we are
790. I don't know if you'd ever want to use
791. that but there it is nonetheless and
792. then one that's really completely crazy
793. is a just color and it's going to allow
794. you to change red green blue hue
795. saturation lightness alpha however
796. you're only going to be able to adjust
797. red green and blue or hue saturation and
798. lightness so you have to decide what's
799. most important to you and when you're
800. defining red green and blue you're going
801. to have to use colors or numbers between
802. 200 and 255 when you're working with Q
803. you're going to use between 0 to 359
804. saturation is going to be 0 to 100
805. lightness is going to be a number
806. between 0 to 100 and alpha is going to
807. be 0 to 1 you're going to use
808. percentages or you know like 0.5 0.8
809. point whatever and like I said before
810. you can only use RGB or hue saturation
811. and lightness and how we're going to use
812. adjust color much the same here let's
813. change this to an 8 and then we're gonna
814. say adjust color - color and then we're
815. going to pass in let's have this be mean
816. green again and then let's define how
817. much red we want so I will do this it's
818. like that and then how much green do we
819. want let's say it's 40 and then how much
820. flu we want so when you use that base
821. color and then adjust it based off of
822. that and there is our weird greenish
823. color and its greenish because there's
824. more green than there is anything else
825. and there's no red and da-da-da-da-da
826. change that to 9 and we can only do red
827. green or blue or hue saturation and
828. lightness so this time let's do hue
829. saturation and lightness
830. thing else is the same as still a just
831. color and this is going to be main green
832. again or at least that's what I'm going
833. to use main green if you want to adjust
834. your hue we're going to put 30 inside of
835. there and or saturation just so you can
836. see what those look like let's make this
837. 40 just have this be simple lightness
838. let's have that be 30 and then alpha
839. let's have it be 0.2 and there's that
840. crazy blue there's a bunch of different
841. things you can do here
842. you could also shade colors like I said
843. I'm covering pretty much every color
844. type of thing you can play with here
845. let's throw another one in there and
846. let's change this to 10 still have a
847. couple more children to play with you
848. could say that you want a shade of
849. whatever color you put inside here I'm
850. going to use yellow and again all these
851. different guys are coming from my
852. variables that I defined early on so
853. let's go in here and say I want a shade
854. of yellow and I need to tell it what
855. percent of black I want combined with
856. this let's say 50% and reload you see
857. it's very sickly looking yellow and
858. likewise there's also a tint which is
859. going to allow you to define how much
860. white you want to add the adding into it
861. so let's just go tint let it be let's
862. change this to yellow again just you can
863. see the difference between them so let's
864. say yellow and how much white let's say
865. 50% up make sure you spell it
866. tint and not 10th and now you can see
867. it's a little bit prettier
868. alright so that's basically all the
869. different color things you have
870. available for you inside of sass now
871. let's go in here and take a look at some
872. other built-in mix-ins that come with
873. compass so let's go down here - well
874. let's shrink this down a little bit all
875. right so let's come down here and round
876. the corners on this guy down here like I
877. said whenever you use the mix-ins that
878. come with compass it's going to
879. automatically generate all the
880. cross-browser stuff for you so let's
881. change the riddle answer and I want to
882. use the compass version so that it will
883. automatically generate all the good
884. stuff so a border radius and here you're
885. going to use I'm going to use 5 pixels
886. make sure you put it inside of this
887. brackets like that and let's say I also
888. want to add a box shadow for this and
889. here we just go include box shadow
890. and I'm going to define my horizontal
891. offset make that five pixels my vertical
892. offset five pixels how much I want it to
893. blur let's say five pixels my spread two
894. pixels and what color do I want it to be
895. I want it to be gray and making sure
896. that's semi colons there and reload it
897. and there you can say now the corner
898. edges are rounded and it also has box
899. shadow and also you're gonna see the CSS
900. that was automatically generated so it's
901. going to style sheets and styles and you
902. can see how all the commenting works and
903. all that stuff and let's scroll way down
904. here to the bottom and you're gonna see
905. that it automatically went in and
906. generated all the cross browser stuff
907. for us that's that's why it's really
908. cool it's just oh it's very very cool
909. now let's go in here and take a look at
910. how we can add a text shadow to this guy
911. right up here well that guy is called
912. main title so I'm going to go main title
913. like this open that up and again I want
914. to use a built-in mix in that comes with
915. compass text shadow and let's say that I
916. want to use an or a gba color here and
917. let's just put blue inside of here and
918. my percentage and then how much of an
919. offset that I want horizontally how much
920. of an offset will I want it to
921. vertically and how much blur do I want
922. wait like this and reload it and you can
923. see there's a shadow there or at least I
924. hope you can see that play around with
925. these things are really cool it just
926. opens up a whole plethora of different
927. things you can do we could also create a
928. gradient so let's say I wanted to turn
929. this boring bar into a gradient up here
930. and in my css3 tutorial I have a whole
931. bunch of gradient type stuff and let's
932. also say that I want to create this just
933. so that I can use it here and down here
934. how exactly do I create a set of
935. properties just to use them somewhere
936. else % that's it and let's say that I
937. want to call this main green gradients
938. and then I want to include put
939. background image and I'm going to say
940. that I want a linear gradient and I need
941. to define where it's going to come from
942. well I can either put left right top or
943. bottom or left top right
944. bottom left bottom right depending upon
945. where I want that to come in from I'm
946. just gonna keep it simple have it be
947. left and I'm gonna say that the start
948. color that I want to use is my main
949. green and I want it to take up 80% of
950. the screen and then I want white to take
951. up the rest of the screen okay so I have
952. that defined I want to use it inside of
953. other things so let's say I want to use
954. it in my footer just go footer and then
955. go at extend means that I want to use
956. this other style that's already been
957. defined for me and gradient and you can
958. see way down here the gradient that
959. shows up inside of there I made a little
960. bit of an error I put a comma right
961. there
962. don't do that leave that out all right
963. so that's how we style that and I could
964. do exactly the same thing for the
965. horizontal nav bar that I have at the
966. top of the screen just by going in here
967. and changing footer to horizontal nav
968. and this guy here is going to change
969. into a gradient now and you can see that
970. it did and it went and created a whole
971. bunch of other things in our regular old
972. CSS files which is really cool as well
973. now these guys over here are bothering
974. me so let's say I want to target one of
975. those and change the image inside of
976. there I'm also at the same time going to
977. show you how SAS makes it very easy to
978. grab images from your images folder no
979. matter where they are so you won't have
980. to use real long names so I want to
981. target an image and I want to target an
982. image with this specific alt of
983. programming frameworks there you go and
984. if I want to change the content I'm
985. going to change the image that's inside
986. of there I go
987. content image and image - URL and then
988. whatever the name of it is inside of my
989. images folder so image dot Peng is what
990. it is semi colon and right like that it
991. loaded it directly inside of there so
992. really neat it's very useful to have
993. everything set up like that like I said
994. over here you might have dot dot forward
995. slash you might have just a forward
996. slash it's going to depend you're going
997. to have to try it and then fix it and do
998. it
999. make it work well it wouldn't make sense
1000. for this I could also have this
1001. automatically get the size of whatever
1002. this is so if I say width and I want to
1003. get my image width I can do so and I
1004. could also get my image height just by
1005. pasting those inner see this kept me
1006. from having to do that but either way
1007. what this is going to do is it's going
1008. to tell me what the image width and
1009. height is of the actual image and then
1010. store it there it's going to make it
1011. grow really big and look ugly but
1012. whatever I just want to show you that
1013. it's very useful not in this context
1014. it's not useful but very often in other
1015. contexts it is useful so I wanted to
1016. cover that another thing we can do is
1017. some of the neater things where we can
1018. scale and move different elements on the
1019. screen horizontally and vertically using
1020. compass so it's going to be like cross
1021. browser or type of stuff that's going to
1022. be automatically generated so let's say
1023. that I wanted to take this little logo
1024. that I have up here and I want to scale
1025. it up and I want to move it to the right
1026. side of the screen how hard is that to
1027. do well I just go little go target my
1028. logo and then @include scale and let's
1029. say I wanted to increase it twice its
1030. size horizontally and vertically there
1031. you go that's all it took to do that and
1032. also I can come in and let's do a
1033. transform and let's move it in the
1034. x-direction 700 pixels you would go
1035. transform translate X 700 pixels right
1036. like that and then let's say that I want
1037. to translate y 10 pixels there we go and
1038. to do another one let's say that we also
1039. want to scale it I could put the scale
1040. inside of here that would work as well
1041. and let's say that I also want to rotate
1042. it on negative 45 degrees that's how
1043. hard that would be to do put the
1044. semicolon there so you put everything
1045. all there on one line and just do
1046. whatever you need to do and you can see
1047. it's over here and it's off the page and
1048. it's but it is rotated and it's
1049. everything so just pulling this stuff
1050. out of my head here for the large part
1051. and get a little bit of goofy things but
1052. either way you get the gist of what's
1053. going on there it is on the screen it's
1054. on its side and it's rotated and all
1055. this other different things okay so what
1056. else can we do well we could use compass
1057. to put a drop shadow on all of our text
1058. inside of let's say this paragraph tag
1059. here which in this situation is going to
1060. be this second child element inside of
1061. there so once again we got article and I
1062. want a paragraph tag and I want the
1063. ninth or I want to get the second child
1064. element and if I want to put some text
1065. shadowing I could go filter drop shadow
1066. and let's say I want to put a gray one
1067. and let's do an offset horizontally one
1068. pixel one pixel vertically and there we
1069. go make sure this is child not Chao
1070. reload it and there you can see is a
1071. little bit of a drop shadow inside of
1072. there let's go make this a little bit
1073. stronger and there we are change the
1074. blur amount to two pixels and there you
1075. can see the blur that's on there there's
1076. a filter effect we can also use with
1077. compass another thing that's neat is we
1078. can change different properties based
1079. off of conditions so let's define this
1080. is just a regular variable I'm going to
1081. call it riddle color and this is how we
1082. define those and how we use conditions
1083. if let's just use an if statement here
1084. so let's say if the value of Riddle
1085. color is equal to blue which it's not
1086. what we want to do is we want to define
1087. riddle as having a background color of
1088. Alice blue and then we could come in
1089. here and say else make sure we put a
1090. tells else like we use in other
1091. programming languages let's go and
1092. change the background color for Riddle
1093. again and this time let's just make it
1094. ash gray and reload it and you can see
1095. that these guys change to ash gray down
1096. here so that's how we can use if and
1097. else statements to change things based
1098. off of pretty much any type of condition
1099. but there's a condition where the value
1100. of this variable is gray and if we would
1101. change this to below let's just do it
1102. we are reload it and now it's below okay
1103. so it works either way the thing we can
1104. do is there's an option to use for loops
1105. inside of SAS
1106. let's go PRC 2% yellow and what we're
1107. going to do is we're going to color
1108. these guys down here in this navigation
1109. ever increasing values of yellow so our
1110. starting off percentage of yellow is
1111. going to be 5% you can use percent you
1112. can use numbers you can use anything how
1113. we use a for loop is going at 4i from
1114. and then let's define what we want so we
1115. have 414 of these guys so we're going to
1116. say 1 through 14 that's how long our for
1117. loop is going to execute and then if we
1118. want to change the color of this we just
1119. go vert nav which surrounds all those
1120. items in our left sidebar navigation
1121. talking about this guy right here
1122. and ul and Li and we're going to be
1123. targeting list items
1124. so we'll say 9th child and then if we
1125. want to put a number inside of here we
1126. have put a number sign like that and
1127. these brackets and then I so it's going
1128. to sort through and it's going to cycle
1129. through each one of those it's one of
1130. the coolest things ok and then if we
1131. want to change the background color for
1132. each one of those it's going to cycle
1133. through each of them and let's say we
1134. want to mix yellow and we want to mix
1135. white and then the amount of yellow we
1136. want to put inside of here is going to
1137. be % yellow like that our variable we
1138. defined and then outside of this after
1139. we exit the fewer loop we can go percent
1140. yellow and that's going to be equal to
1141. percent yellow plus 5 percent and you
1142. could say I would ever increasing values
1143. of yellow say started off at 5 percent
1144. went all the way up to a hundred percent
1145. I like that what else can we do one
1146. other thing that's really cool is we can
1147. use spriting with compass and basically
1148. what it's going to do is it's going to
1149. combine a whole bunch of images that we
1150. provide in a folder and it's going to
1151. convert them into one image which is
1152. going to limit our server quests so to
1153. do that inside of our images folder you
1154. can see here I have icons and here's all
1155. these icons what it's going to do is
1156. it's going to take all these and it's
1157. going to create them all in one image
1158. and it's going to automatically going to
1159. provide the proper background image
1160. definition and location for each of the
1161. elements in the sprite so let's say
1162. sounds like a lot of work let's go in
1163. and show you how easy it is so
1164. first off we need to import the ability
1165. to work with sprite so we'll go import
1166. and this should be at the top of the
1167. screen but I just want to keep
1168. everything here at one place so
1169. utilities and sprites like this then if
1170. we want to import all those images we go
1171. import and we define whatever the folder
1172. name was which it was icons and then we
1173. go a star thought they're all ping files
1174. and this only works for ping files as
1175. far as I know and then we're going to
1176. say include all icons sprites like this
1177. and now what we'll be able to do is
1178. target I have you don't see them here on
1179. the screen but if we go in here wait at
1180. the bottom the screen you can see right
1181. here see I have a class called icons and
1182. a whole bunch of these divs inside of
1183. here with the specific class names so I
1184. can come back over here and I can just
1185. go icons target that and then clock app
1186. and then to include it I just go include
1187. icons sprite and clock and then do this
1188. for all the other icons then I could go
1189. icons and everything inside of that div
1190. and define the height I'm just doing
1191. this so everything shows up on the
1192. screen you can use these wherever you
1193. want 64 pixels and reload it and there
1194. you can see all this sprites show up
1195. inside of there and what's also cool is
1196. we can open this up and styles - all
1197. this stuff is being generated and you
1198. can see all the background positions for
1199. all of our different items is going to
1200. be automatically generated for us so see
1201. icons there's a clock there's the diary
1202. and the background position for each of
1203. those so they're all in one image
1204. automatically it creates them and you
1205. can see all of that stuff right there so
1206. really cool and then the final thing I'm
1207. going to do is I'm going to mess around
1208. this ugly table that's down here see
1209. there's this table I'm going to show you
1210. how to clean that up make it look a
1211. little bit nicer with compass and we're
1212. going to say import and compass
1213. utilities again and tables is where this
1214. guy resides and the name of this is
1215. baseball stats and we're going to
1216. specifically target our table and we use
1217. something called scaffolding table let's
1218. include table scaffolding and we
1219. to find our inner border by going
1220. include this is something else you guys
1221. can play with different colors and
1222. things and there's our border and
1223. borders and let's just make this four
1224. pixels and let's define the table color
1225. as table color it's a variable I think I
1226. saved over here I guess I didn't so
1227. let's go and put this right here
1228. table color and let's just make it black
1229. just to keep it simple so there's table
1230. color semicolon there so that's going to
1231. define the inner table borders and we
1232. can also define our outer table borders
1233. outer and let's just keep this simply
1234. let's make this Duke blue there we are
1235. and then we can handle table striping as
1236. well include alternating rows and column
1237. and let's say that I want my even row
1238. color to be Alice blue and my odd row
1239. color to be ash gray the intersection of
1240. those let's just make this table color
1241. and then let's say that I want my header
1242. color to be white
1243. save that reload it and there you can
1244. say Alice blue and gray and all the
1245. table headers are always so here you go
1246. guys there are a ton of different things
1247. you can do with sass as well as compass
1248. hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
1249. please leave your questions and comments
1250. below

1.以及互联网您好，欢迎来我
在这个教程2.酱油视频教程
3.显示所有的很酷的事情可以做
4.青菜以及指南针这是一个
5框架，是建立在顶部青菜
6.我有一大堆这样做，让我们
7.进入它，所以你可能会问自己，为什么
8.将我们曾经想用青菜以及它
9.基本上将允许我们写出
10多维护的代码更快现在
11. CSS你通常将是
12瞄准各个元素，然后
13造型的那些元件和问题
14与被如果使用相同的
15属性的多个元素你
16.去到必须键入这些属性
在以上和一遍一遍17.
18.井SASS将要提供给我们
19.变量和函数和一个整体
20.一堆那些即将到其他事情
21.代替将允许我们重用那些
我们定义所以对于22性质
23.例如，如果我们只想处理颜色
24.我们会在这里 是让我们说我们
25.有EF日光盘，这是非常丑陋
26.什么青菜会允许我们做
27.取而代之的是定义一个变量叫
28杏仁表示这个颜色和
29.那么我们只需要输入在这家伙
30.在这里，什么那将
31让我们做的是那么我们随时要
32来定义我们的颜色，我们可以改为
33杏仁这是非常非常只需键入
34.有用的，这是多么容易它是
35界定青菜和内部变量，
你会看到更多的这种为36.
37.教程继续是这样的事
38很酷的是我们要能够
39.定义属性一旦与逻辑
40名像你杏仁在那里看到和
41.然后一遍又一遍又一遍重复使用
42再次，什么也真棒关于
43.是我们要能够发现
44名逻辑一次，然后用它
宽45文件，它也将是
46很容易改变，因为它会
47.将设在一个地方，另一件事
48.这是 伟大的约青菜是指南针这
49就像我之前说过这是一个框架
50.是建立在萨斯这将允许
51.我们自动生成属性
52.创建跨浏览器的CSS和整个
53一堆其他不同的东西
54.你会看到，例如，如果你想
55界定唉翻译以及一个
56刻度的对象或元素的一个
在CSS 57.你必须输入所有的
58了这一点，而不是用青菜和指南针
59.我们可以，而不是仅仅去包括和
60.然后变换，然后翻译为什么
61. 50％，规模1/2扔那家伙
自己和指南针的62方打算
63自动生成所有这些东西
64。你这样，将工作跨浏览器
65.但是你可以看到，这是很多
66更整洁的另一件事是
67.真正酷的是上海社科院我们将
68能够使用嵌套规则
69 。不同的状态，以便代替打字
70.这项除以一切行动
71.我们反而要能来
72.在这里，去水平导航，然后
73去我们的链接定义我们的色彩为
74静态链接，然后在这里把里面
75.一种结肠和悬停和定义我们的
76色的变化，每当我们的链接
77 。上空盘旋，我们可以抛出杏仁
中有78以及好，因为它是一个
79变量但是我们会在输入
80杏仁就是这样所以这是另一种
是我们要能够81.整洁的事情
82.用于组织我们的代码和SAS是
83也将能够自动
84.我们压缩我们所有的代码，所以我们的页面
85.是加载更快它也打算让
86很容易地优化许多不同
87.屏幕尺寸和在本教程中，我
88将集中在扩展模块小号CSS
89版SAS的，所以当我们跳过去和
90.告诉你究竟如何我们要
91.现在安装此SAS将要使用
92与钢轨所以这就是为什么它的原因，
在我的rails教程93.如果你想知道
94为什么它的里面有，这就是
95去ŧ Ø意味着你将需要
96到有轨自动安装
97在这里对里面所有这些东西到
98的工作，并在链路上的说明
99.我的教程以及如何正确地
100安装导轨是非常非常容易的
101网站，基本上步行通过
102整个全过程后，现在你
103拥有所有的设置，让我们确保
104我们有轨道的正确版本和
105.我们的系统上安装Ruby和这是
你要106输入什么到你的
107计算机和终端它没有
，如果你是在Windows 108此事，或者如果你
109都在OSX或Linux或什么，然后
110.我要去吉姆更新没有-或DOC
111，这是要更新所有的宝石
112只是为了确保我们有
113一切都完全一样，然后
114就可以在Ruby中键入- V和你”重新去
115看看，我们有红宝石2.2是
116大，钢轨- V和我们有轨
117的设置，以及现在你要去什么
118要 做的是安装指南针和
119指南针需要青菜所以它要
120自动安装它，您的
121吉姆安装指南针，你可能需要
的有122里面输入sudo你可以看到
123就这样吧明白了，一切都
124.所有已安装的，现在我们就可以去到
125 SAS - V和我们看到我们有SAS
安装126和指南针- V和我们看到
的是，我们已经安装好了指南针127.
128.现在我们所拥有的一切安装
129是它究竟会如何努力成为
130我们创建一个项目，我们只是
131将输入指南针创建，然后
132.我要叫这个测试一个无论
你想要133打电话给你的，你去
134和它会自动生成
135阿昂你我要去输入以及
136让我们澄清这LS并有测试一个
137.我们要我们的目录更改为
138 。测试之一，你可以在这里看到的一切
安装139如果我想打开所有
的崇高140.这我只是要输入
141。苏BL和一个点，有它会
142.去它要开拓
143.一切，我现在需要让我们
144这里路过，其实看一看
145.我们得到了什么，所以我们拿到的第一件事情
146.这里是配置点RB这是非常
147.重要的让我们打开它，去
148经过正是我们这里有这个
149.主要有所有我们配置的
150两个故障插件应该如何CSS
151产生和两个什么目录在这里
152.你可以看到所有的不同的
153目录中我们将被存储
在154所有的东西，所以我们有我们的CSS
我们的图片155目录或青菜目录
156目录，我们的Java脚本目录
157。在这里这个HTTP路径可能是
158或者是你正斜杠或者
159可以有两个矿点在它之前
160其实有两个点，因此您可以
161.实验与一点点的向下
162.在这里，你可以看到我们的输出方式和我们
163有几个不同的选择这里
164嵌套将要使用缩进 ■当
165定义嵌套样式我们已经花了
166看看嵌套紧凑打算把
167所有的CSS代码在一行
168，而不是使用不同的线路为
169属性中的每一个，当他们“重新
定义和压缩170就是我们
171去当我们准备好使用
172现场，这是要除去
173注释以及空白
174.我不小心跳过这家伙在这里
175 。在那里我们有我们的插件，如果你是
176.将要使用插件你
177.只是要输入要求，然后
178无论你的插件名称是像
179.例如sussy是一个插件，我会
180可能包括在未来
181 toriel，如果你想看到这
182被允许我们使用网格系统
183内的位置是非常有用的
184好这个人到这里，如果没有注释
185会允许使用一个辅助
186功能指向您的图片文件夹
187.我们在这里定义，我会得到
188多成 一点点这家伙
189.到这里，如果主动将显示
190评论说，要指向
你的CSS 191青菜源，这是
你需要知道的192基本上都
193左右的配置，现在点RB文件还有
194等方式来这里并创建
195项目中，我们也可以来这里和
196是非常非常具体，我们去指南针
197.创建，如果你想定义你的
198青菜目录好比说像这样的青菜
199.然后你想给特定的名字
200.基本上它是什么，这将
201通过电子邮件CSS，然后你的JavaScript
202目录，这将只用于如果
203不希望使用默认的Java
DIR 204脚本，让我们只说我们就
在205处BJS
206，然后在这里呆上一个行，如果你
207也想确定你的图片
208目录，你可以做到这一点，就像是
209，这就是所有你需要输入和
210回车，指南针会去和
211.你很创建项目
212。特定文件夹的名字，但是这一个
213.我只是要坚持什么，我们
214有在这里不妨去这里
215，这是基本上是一切的
216将在这里工作都将是所有
217 。您的SASS文件CF CSS而这正是
218你将要放那些和
219.这里将是样式表
220这将是自动
的基于断码的为您生成221
222.你这么喜欢我们以前看到写在这里
223.每当我们要产生
224跨浏览器CSS，我们希望指南针
225.这样做对我们好，我们将定义
226.我们必须在这里非常
227 。简单的格式，然后罗盘
228产生复杂的跨浏览器的代码，
所以现在我什么都以229到这里好吗
230做的是创造了一堆的部分文件，
231是打算让我们分头行动
232 。我们的CSS和真正酷的约
233青菜是它会允许我们分割
234起来，而在同一时间不是
235 requir 每封多个HTTP请求
236，因此，我们正要进入这个
237人，然后进入青菜和我们
238要创建一个新的文件夹，我们
239要调用它的谐音而那里，
240是和会自动将
241以崇高的文本显示在这里，我们是
在崇高的文本超过242则有
243谐音现在我们要创建一个
244一大堆不同的文件，所以新的
245.文件，什么
246会打电话给这个人，让我们的文件保存为
247，让我们把这个家伙强调基地
248下划线是非常重要的，
249则s CSS，让我们保存，让我们
250只创建了一大堆更使创建
251新的，然后文件保存为我们要去
252拥有一切在这里完成的
253起变量，就是我们
254要存储所有一堆变量
255，并确保这是下划线高达
256这里如果你不能说下划线和
257.然后点S CSS有基地，这是
258的第一个，如果你做不发 ee值它和
259.然后创建另一部分另存为，
260让我们叫这个家伙的布局，这是
261.通常，你会才刚刚
262定义的布局部分
263应用程序，我可能会或可能不会使用在
264。本教程还没有决定
265和新发现我所说的布局的意思是
266的元素在屏幕上如何布局
267，而不是在它们的性能和
268另存为，这家伙将是
269 mix-插件这是真正冷你
270会看到那些在这里第二个
271，然后多一个部分文件和文件
272保存为这家伙将是
273叫归思想小号CSS和保存
274是在这里，我们是让我们去了
275到基地首先我要说的是，
276的东西SASS意见，如果你想
277.使单行注释这是怎么了
，你做278单行注释，只是
279知道，在这之后可能无法呈现
280，这是从S CSS文件变成了
281 CSS文件，然后你必须多行
282 COMME 国税厅的意见，他们将结束
283与明星和一个右括号，我们
284通常把他们像这样和这些
285家伙肯定会显示出每当
286.一切都被编译成一个CSS文件
287.但它可能不会显示在那里你想
288，如果你想保证它会
289.显示和它会准确显示
290，你把它放在你会用什么
291.所谓大声评论，他们出来
292正是这样只要把
293.感叹号的工作和你去那里和
294可以是正面的，这些将显示
295了今日我想要做的是定义
我的应用程序的296标准化部分和
297.这是我使用的家伙我把
298的链接的描述以及
299.有无数的所有这些家伙了
300那里，你可以使用你可以使用
301不管你
302.喜欢，如果你已经拥有的东西，但
303基本上如果你不知道这是什么
304只是HTML元素的集合，
305属性，它们将范数 艾莉婕
306在所有浏览器的样式
307，你可以复制这个家伙的权利
308.这里，然后跳过这里
309正常化小号CSS这家伙就在这里和
310粘贴在与保存和你”再
与规范化小号CSS完成311.现在我想
312进入变量部分，什么
313，我要在这里做的是我只是去
314在一大堆的复制和粘贴
315变量所以你可以看到到底有
那些是316定义的，我将使用
317也许站点范围，然后从这个点
318.我就可以直接把它们由
319他们的小美元签署无论
320名我为他们提供合适的位置和
321.有些人每当他们命名
322的变量，如命名基于关闭的
323在那里，而颜色将用于
324人喜欢的名字，代表的
325色我基本上只是随大流
326，只是做什么，但我更喜欢
327有变量名是逻辑
328.听起来不错，我和/或我们的摹 OOD
的任何颜色我329表示
330使用另一件事只是为了掩饰漂亮的
331多一切，你也可以把它定义一个
332错误让我们说我们有一个默认的
333姑且称之为文本颜色，并让我们
334 。这种黑色，然后把感叹号
335和默认，我们在这里说什么
336是这是那将默认的
337，如果未设置值或只使用
338签署其他任何地方所以现在我们有
339.所有这些设置什么是我们要的
340做才能让他们在我们的显示
341的样式表以及我们得来
了342和创造我们的样式部分
343的样式表的东西到这儿
344到SASS区域，只是去一个新的文件
345和我要去这个保存为文件另存为
346点的样式SC SS和保存和我
347.在SASS目录保存它，我
348.忘了东西在我们这里
349.终端，我们想要做的是第一关
350。让我们确保我们在正确的
351目录我们，如果我们想补偿 个屁
352自动更新或创建我们的CSS
353文件的时间间隔，我们改变任何时间
354中的文件，我们一般项目
355我们要做的就是输入指南针和
356的手表，并输入和它是怎么回事在去
357那里，并自动生成所有的
358对我们和所有的变化中的文件
359，我们让你可以说，这是怎么回事
360编译这些文件，如果我们跳到
361.在这里，你现在可以见
362.那里，如果我们点击样式点CSS它
363是存在以及作为在这里
好吗364.所以现在我们有一个内部
的有365如何，我们要进口罗盘
366例如我们要说进口
367.然后罗盘得到了安装和
368.我们也打算要导入我们的
369变量，以便进口，这是
370的谐音和变量，然后我们
371将进口更多的这些，但让我们
372也进口泛音正常化，现在
373.我们有我们已经创建了，所以一切
374.到目前为止我们所有的样式里面点S CSS
375.文件实际上我把他们错了
376一个让我们把它砍下来这里我把它们贴

381我们已经准备好，现在去我要去的
382这里创建我的index.html文件，所以
383只是去这里和我米要去和
384拷贝，在我所有索引文件粘贴
385所看到的一切就在那里，它只是
386.所有这些东西将是可用
387在视频下方的说明
388.我要救该文件保存为
389.我的主要项目区为index.html，然后
390保存这一点，你可以看到这里
391.我有什么样式表和样式点
392 CSS保存，现在你可以看到，如果我加载
393。这在这里浏览器是所有的
394 HTML它是一种乱七八糟的，但在
395场本教程来解决整个
396一堆东西，但我要去
397.在这里和粘贴 有的只是定期
在我的风格398. CSS代码点S CSS文件，
399我要加入一个一大堆
其他400不同的事情，但是这仅仅是
401基本上是普通的旧CSS，你可以
402使用该课程以s CSS以及的
403，没有任何问题，让我们保存
404和重新加载它，看看事情已经
405改变，你去那里，你可以看到
406，有些事情正在寻找好的和
407的一些事情被乱七八糟的一点点
408.我要回去了跳进我的
409项目，我要去一个新的文件夹
410，这将被称为图像
411.记得我没有自动
412.产生这些，但我发现你怎么说
413.你能和我干脆来
这里414，并把Java的脚本，以及
415的Java脚本，当然，我们希望
416确保这些是相同的作为我们的
417.配置文件但在此之前，我们做的是跳
418的图像和一些图像粘贴
419.我这里有我的网站，并有
420的配置点[R B档和是它的
421称为Java得分
422起坐和图像，这被称为图像
423和JavaScript等等一切都在寻找
424好现在没事了，我贴这些图片
中让我们重新加载425它，它看起来有点
426。位更好，但我们要解决一些
现在427的东西走了，我要跳过去
428到基材S CSS和我去定义
429.一些默认的是我要去现场有
广泛的是430间没有“T覆盖了
我的网站431标准化一部分，所以我要去
432说类似的身体和定义
433字体系列以及宋体黑体
434和所有这些其他不同的东西
435.这里另一件事里面我想
436做的是我要定义的文本颜色
用什么叫做一个mixin所以我要去437.
438.进入我的合辑以s CSS和混合插件
439基本上只是功能，我们可以
440 。值传递到他们要做
我们441.某些事情，我们如何定义
442一个是我们去拌入，我们可以说，
443默认的文本颜色，我们将举 ST呼叫
444.这个TC的文本颜色，然后我们将
445说颜色是TC右像其他
446件事你可以做的是，如果你想
447有一个默认的为你肚子里的情况下，
448这个功能是所谓的，没有什么是
449在其内部通过，我们能做到这一点
450只这样的，但这个呀，让我们
451刚刚离开这种方式，所以这是
452基本上只是将允许我们
453定义颜色现在，让我们跳回在
454到基CSS文件，并让我们使用
455那MIXIN所以如果我们要定义我们
这里456的颜色，我们会说@include
457默认的文本颜色这是我们的名字
458给了我们的功能，让我们通过在
459黑什么的会为我们做的
460自动将吐出这家伙出
461与任何颜色的内被传递
462，这正是在这里所以这是一个很好的
为463简单的方法我们定义了一些不同
，我们希望464的东西，你可以做很多事情
，因为我们要去的事情混插件465.
466.这里看到它在菊 ST片刻也将
467种想来这里，我想
468把一个包装它会环绕
469.一切，让我们来这里并修复
470的一些问题，我们在这里看到的
471.我们的浏览器我们的网站，什么是
472发生在这里，我们还是有很多的
473重叠的问题，所以我们想要做的
474是我们要确保我们的
475呈现箱元素包括
476填充和边界，无论
477.否则，确保它们适合与
478是我们定义的内部宽度
479网站，以及我们如何能做到这一点仅仅是
480去的明星，在这里我只是会去
481箱的WebKit -sizing去边境盒状
482.我说这只是会说，如果我们定义
483的宽度包括填充和
484.边界，例如与任何宽度，我们
485定义这里面你会看到
486。在这里第二个是什么，这看起来像
487和箱大小的边界框，然后
488.最后盒大小调整边框框另一个
489件事我想demonst 这里率
再次嵌套490，因为它是相当
491.重要的有青菜只是想
492.确保您了解它让我们说
493，我特别希望所有目标
我的链接标签494，这是这里的内部
495。文章元素中所有这
496的东西在这里内部
497.所以我们要说的文章，这些
498皆为P标签里面只是让你
499.知道我说的是，我们在这里
500 。让我们去到这里，你可以看到正确的
501这里是文章和P标签，然后将
这些p标签内502链接，这就是
503.我想在这里集中在和咱们
504说，我希望他们有我的默认
505的蓝色，在这里我使用的是可变的
，当然506，如果我想他们改变
507到悬停别的东西
508.我只是把与和悬停一样，而
509让我们也说专注让我们做，因为
510也就是这样是多么容易确保
511你把结肠内这里和
512.随后，每当他们有悬停或聚焦我
51 3.要对这些颜色更改为
514。我所说的公爵蓝色，然后我可以
515也再次改变我的颜色如果是
516访问色彩，让我们有这个是
517蓝灰色，文件保存，现在我
518想要做的是使用所有这些样式
519，我在这里有我的风格SCS
520文件，所以我将不得不进来和
521的进口，以及和你要
522.看到，这里例如如何
523.不排队等各类
524不同的事情将是
525在第二修正这里哦，说这是
526恐怖我们进行了修复，而且我们已经
527。为什么我们只需要导入基地和
528，我们还需要导入混在这样
529.让我们去的谐音组合插件
530，然后我们想要做同样的事情，
531为基础，以便基地，然后我们要是
532做用指南针一吨的东西
533. CSS3样式和使用他们你要
534到有
535波托斯会说指南针点CSS3如果
536我将保存并看到一些THI NGS固定了
537。
549.指导您如何改变整个
这里550一堆不同的东西对
551屏幕好了，第一件事
552.我打算做的是，我将是
553瞎搞这个导航它是在
554这里，所以这里是那家伙在这里是
555.这就是所谓的垂直导航栏
556左侧可以看到右边有什么
557.我将做的是集中在
558所有这些链接标签而我要
559改变它们的颜色，我也要去
560变化为基础的颜色掉悬停为
561以及那么我们如何做到这一点回到
562的样式，让我们只是去就在这里以
563所以，如果我想针对的底部
，当然564刚刚离开侧边栏和
565。当然，这是左侧栏的链接这个
566人就在这里，它的定义为
567级，这很好，因为我想要
568。针对一大堆他们这样侧边栏
569的链接和我想在这里做不好什么
570的一个或这里中的链接我想
571去显示：块刚 打算让
572他们像块元素这样的话我想
573.其颜色更改为主要绿化
574，让我们说，我想换
575的不透明度的默认不透明度
然而576. 70％时，他们都徘徊
577.在这里我要进来，走出去悬停
578，并改变其不透明度
579情况百分百让我们
580是保存并重新加载这一点，你可以
581.现在看到那里，他们看到了不透明度为
582 。改变所以这只是一个
在这里筑巢内583.示范
584.非常重要的，这就是为什么我的原因
585.覆盖它一大堆倍
586.让我们说我也想提出一个边界
各587下这些家伙的除外
588.最后一个究竟如何我做什么
589.那好，我会去左侧边栏，我
590通常打破这些成多个文件
591，只是保持这种方式，使
592几乎所有的这里所有的在一个
593的地方，所以我们可以去边框底部和
594让我们这两个像素 固体和
595.让我们使用绿色缅因州再次接近，
596关，如果我想把
597.为了随处可见，除了与上次
598孩子以及我可以是这样的
599和最后一个孩子，并说边界：无为
600 。一个并重新加载，你可以说
601每个人都有一个边界它下面
602除了最后一个孩子是正确的
603有它的整洁知道的是你
604也可以嵌套CSS属性，以便例如
605。比方说，我刚才例如元素
606只是这样做只是为了做到这一点我能来
这里607和保存边框上，然后顶部有一个
608像素的蓝色实，然后做的都是
对其他的和609同样的事情
610.将允许您更改这些默认
611性能以及那我们不会
612使用，只需一个覆盖它，因为
613它来到介意另一件事是
614整洁是我们可以扩展现有的
615。性能让我们在这里讲下来，我们
616有一个谜，它说一个父亲和他的儿子
617骑着自己的自行车和一个坠毁 ð等等
618等等等等等等等等不管它没有
619真正的问题，让我们说，我们要
620的目标是下了这个谜底部分
621那里，这里是它的一个ID谜语
622看到那里就在那里跳回
在这里623就是我们要在这里做的是
624找到了一些东西，然后用它
625内的另一个元素，所以我们说20个
626像素填充和利润排名前10位的像素
627.然后我们可以说谜语的答案是
628的它下面什么如下，并采取
629或者一切所有的属性定义
630就在这里，并把它们记录下来的内部
631.这里，我们如何做到这一点是在去扩展
632，然后这个谜底，是要采取
633.所有这些特性，把它们放在那里
634，就好像他们在那里一直和
635.然后我们也可以很好的利润率谈话10
其实636像素这一个，我想
637赚这点不同让我们把
638这个背景色，让我们做
639这爱丽丝蓝色和重新加载它，你
640可以看到有 它显示了在
641背景和填充物
从里德尔借来的，并在使用642
643谜语的答案是正确的，我们有
644也可以进来，定义属性
645或创建属性只是这样我们就可以
646.延长他们，基本上只是
647的手段，我们会去把％和点缀
648箱例如与边界，比方说
649公爵蓝色所以这只是创建
650，以便它可以被其他使用元素
651和保证金和
652像素和零个像素现在我们所能
653做的就是去再次谜语答案
654和扩展的内部输入虚线框
655那里，它会采取所有这
656属性并将它们添加在那里你
657现在可以看到它有一个虚线框周围
658它，这样也整齐进入一些
659不同的性质，我们可以玩
660让我们与我们的左侧边栏链接
661摆弄那些和我们通话
662.边框的颜色，让我们说，如果我们要
663照亮它，我们可以去减轻和
664。我们将在缅因州绿色传递为
665，我们希望用我们的边框的颜色
666的颜色，让我们说，我们想减轻
667.它由70％，我们可以做到这一点重装，你
668可以看到，那些有打火机吨
669.这些东西装青菜里面的
670以及指南针，你可以做
671完全相同的事情变暗所以
672只是把暗，有内部
673，而不是减轻，所以我会保存重装
674.在那里你可以看到它的几乎是黑色的
675，你也可以生成一个180度的
676恭维色彩的让我们打开了一个
677的网站，我们在这里，这是一个例子
就是我讲的678你会
679.能够改变颜色的色调
由内走动这里680内
该轮681.这里面让我们说
682我们想要去搜索按钮，这是
683.这家伙的权利在这里有你
684.搜索按钮，让我们说，
685每当它徘徊想改变它的
686色背景色做补
whatev的687 呃它让我们拥有它是
688种主要绿化是我想要的颜色
与689的工作，现在你可以看到，当我
690悬停在它改变了补
691色我要去通过整个
692.这些一堆你也可以颠倒一个
693色让我们只是去搜索按钮
周围694悬停玩这个有点
695和调整我的色调再次它会
696.你通过什么颜色的只是色相
697.这里里面，所以如果我有缅因州绿色
698，我想通过90度，将其改为
699是非常具体的，我可以做到，它的排序
像紫色700现在代替的
701酒红色现在我要去进来
702这里摆弄这些家伙
703批次或垂直导航让我们跳到
704在这里，看看这些人恰恰是如何
705都设置了
706还有我们的垂直导航我'米
707将做的是抓住了
这个VERT和大道的708子元素
709，我们有权里面这里的
710当然，这是一个unorder 编辑列表，我想
711获得列表项，所以我将是
712针对这些的子元素
713的列表项
714，我们要如何针对那些是
715只是去VERT现在无序列表清单
716项的列表项我想锁定
717的孩子，我想要得到的第一个孩子
718背景颜色，让我们说，我想
719使用饱和度只是通过每个要去
不同类型的东西的一个720你
721.能做到这里，你可以看到在右边
的屏幕722一侧怎么回事，以
723的工作和饱和度80％为橙色
724，我传递，你可以清楚地看到
725怎么样，看起来现在的我“M基本上只是
726会做使用同样的事情，
727多个不同颜色的变化选项
728可用与SAS让我们说
729，与内部的第二个元素
730是垂直导航我想尝试
731。饱和它只是饱和改变它
732一样，
733，我可以就这么走了80和橙色
734并重新加载它，你可以看到豪 W在所述
735.改变别人那是多色彩的
比我也许可以做一个736专家
737多一点，但我只是去
738通过，并显示你所有的
739不同的东西，都可以和
740，你可以在你自己跟他们玩你
741也可以定义为透明胶片
742这些家伙的只是要在并键入
淡出743.而且有另外一个我
744不记得它被称为像
745透明眼睛是它同样的事情，
746不正是因为淡出一回事
747淡出总是让我更有意义所以
748我用的淡出，让我们说，我想用
一次749橙色，但我想要做的50％和
750重装，你可以看到一切都改变了
751.他们来到这里，并在它放大回事
752得到一点点靠不住，但因为我是
753重点的垂直导航
并没有真正754。事我也可以
755使色彩更加不透明，为此
756一个我会使用淡入和橙色是
757工程，让我们只是有 这是0.8
758哎呦改变第一个孩子让我们的
759变化的第四个孩子，而不是我们可以
760也定义在这里内部RGB颜色，使
761让我们改变这5和这
762只是要一点点红一
蓝绿色一点点的763点点
764和阿尔法雷德·格林蓝的一点点
765阿尔法然后我们要定义
我们要为每一个766.金额
767这些所谓让我们这个是0 0 205
768我们的阿尔法好你真的疯了
769之类的东西混合两种颜色在一起，
770则找到的第一个百分比
771色，你如何做到这一点是通过输入
的组合772
773.然后我们可以不喜欢
774的黄色将是第一种颜色，我们
775要与白混合在一起
776.我们多少黄色希望这是
777，让我们拥有它50％和你可以看到它
778改变那里现在变成6
779.所以我们可以把一切都在屏幕上
一次全部780
781.还有吨着色OPTIO的 NS我
782.你展示他们中的很多，但不是所有的
783这些
784，你也可以强制颜色是
785灰度，所以你传递一种颜色，你
786说给我的灰度版本
787这个颜色，我给你让我们只是
788来到这里一样，你可以看到
789有我们是
790.我不知道你会永远想使用
791说但它仍不失为和
792然后一个是真正完全疯狂的
793是一个公正的颜色，这将允许
794.你改变雷德·格林蓝色调
795饱和度亮度阿尔法但是
796.你只能够调整
797.红，绿，蓝色或色相饱和度和
798亮度，所以你必须决定什么是
799最重要的是你，当你
800定义红，绿，蓝，你要去
801不得不之间使用颜色或号码
802和200 255，当你带Q的工作
803.你要去0之间使用359
804饱和度将是0到100
805亮度将是一个数
之间0 806 100和阿尔法是要
807为0至1，你要使用
808百分比或你知道像0.5 0.8
809点什么就像我之前说的
810，你只能使用RGB或色相饱和度
811和明度以及我们如何要使用
812调整颜色几乎相同的位置，让我们
813更改为8，然后我们要
814说调整颜色-颜色，然后我们
815要在咱们通过有这样的小气
又816绿色，然后让我们来定义如何
817多红色，我们希望，所以我会做到这一点的
818一样，再怎么多的绿色我们
819希望让我们说这是40，然后多少
820感我们想的那么当您使用基地
821色，然后根据脱调整它
822是有我们的怪异绿
823色和绿色的，因为有
824多个绿色之外还有别的
825，有没有红和DA-DA-DA-DA-DA
826更改，到9，我们只能做红
827.绿色或蓝色或色相饱和度和
828亮度所以这段时间让我们做色相
829饱和 和亮度
830别的东西是一样的还是公正
831色，这将是主打绿色环保
832再次或至少这就是我要去
833.如果要调整使用绿色为主
834.你色相我们打算把30的内部
835那里，或饱和，所以您可以
836看看那些看起来像我们让这
837 40只有这个是简单的亮度
838，让我们有一个是30，然后阿尔法
839 。让我们这是0.2，还有那
840疯狂的蓝色有一堆不同的
841的东西，你可以在这里做
842.你也可以遮荫的颜色一样，我说
843，我涵盖几乎每一个颜色
844类型的东西你可以在这里打
845，让我们扔在那里另一个和
846，让我们将其更改为10仍然有
847对夫妇更多的孩子和你一起玩
848可以说，你想要的阴影
849.你把任何颜色内在这里我
850将使用黄色，并再次所有这些
851不同的家伙从我的未来
，我对这么早确定852变量
85 3.让我们在这里说，我希望有一个灯罩
的黄色和854，我需要告诉它
我想联合855％的黑
856这让我们说50％，并刷新你看
857.它是病得很重面色发黄和
858同样也有一个色调是
859要允许您定义多少
860白色您要添加的添加进去
861.所以我们只去色调让它让我们
再次862.这种变化只是黄色你可以
863看出它们之间的差别让我们
864说黄色，多少白比方说，
865出50％以上，确保你拼了
866色而不是10，现在你可以看到
867这是一个有点漂亮
868好的，所以这基本上是所有
你有869不同的颜色的东西
870为您提供的青菜里面现在
871让我们在这里来看看一些
872其他内置混合插件来与
873指南针所以，让我们到这里-以及
874让我们缩小下来一点点的所有
875右所以让我们来这里，圆
876.在这个角落 人到这里就像我
877说，只要你使用的混合，这些插件
878配备了指南针它要
879自动生成所有
880跨浏览器的东西给你，让我们的
881的变化之谜的答案，我想
882使用指南针版本，以便将
883自动生成所有的好
884的东西，所以边框半径，在这里你
885.要使用我打算用5个像素
886。确保你把它里面这
887架这样的，比方说，我也
888要添加一个盒子阴影，这和
889在这里，我们只是去包括盒阴影
890，我去定义我的水平
891偏移做出五个像素我纵
892偏移五个像素我是多么想
893.模糊，让我们5个像素我的分布于两个
894像素，并且我希望它是什么颜色的
895.我想它是灰色的，并确保
896这半冒号那里，重新装入
897.在那里你可以说现在的拐角
898边缘圆润，它也有盒
899的影子，你也要去 看到CSS
所以它是自动生成900
将样式表和样式901，你
902可以看到所有的评论作品和
903所有的东西，让我们滚动的方式下来
这里904的底部和你”再会看到
905，它自动地走进去，
906所产生的所有的跨浏览器的东西
907.我们这，这就是为什么它是真正
908冷却它只是哦，这是非常非常酷的
909，现在让我们在这里看看
910我们如何添加一个文本阴影，这家伙
911直到这里还有那个家伙叫
912主标题，所以我要去主标题
913这样的开放是了，我再次希望
914在使用在内置混合自带
915指南针文字阴影，让我们说，我
916要使用或者这里GBA颜色和
917，让我们只是把这里和蓝色内
918我的百分比，然后多少一个
919偏移，我想水平有多大
的偏移920将我希望它
921垂直和多少模糊我想要
922等待像日 是并重新加载它，你可以
923看到有阴影存在，或者至少我
924希望你能看到，玩弄
925.这些事情真的很酷，它只是
926开辟了不同的整体过剩
927的东西，你能做到，我们也可以创建一个
928梯度让我们说，我希望把
929这个镗杆成梯度在这里
930和我的CSS3教程中，我有整整
931一堆渐变类型的东西，让我们
932也说，我要创建这只是
933，这样我可以在这里使用它，到这里
934究竟如何我创建了一套
935性能只是在某处使用它们
936％还有就是它，让我们说，我
937 。要调用这个绿色为主梯度
938，然后我想包括把
939的背景图片，我会说
940，我希望有一个线性渐变，我需要
941定义到哪里去来自
942好吧，我可以要么把左右上角或
943上下或左右右上
944左下方取决于右下角
945，我想那 来从我
946只是要保持它的简单拥有它是
947左右，我会说，一开始
948的颜色，我想用我的主要
949.绿色，我希望它占用80％
950的屏幕，然后我想白拿
951在屏幕的休息好了，所以我有
952是定义我想用它里面的
其他东西953让我们说，我想用
954。它在我的页脚只是去尾，然后
955走在延长的手段，我想用
956这个其他风格包括已经
957定义了我和梯度，你可以
958看到一路下滑这里的梯度
959节目最多的有内我做了一个小
960位的错误，我把一个逗号权
961.有
962不这样做，留下了所有的权利
963.所以这就是我们的风格，我可以
964做的都是同样的事情
，我必须在965水平导航栏
刚刚在这里发生了966，屏幕上方
967和不断变化的页脚水平NAV
968，在这里这个家伙是不会改变
969成克 adient现在，你可以看到，
970它没有和它去创造一个整体
971一堆在我们普通的旧其他的东西
972 CSS文件，这是真的很酷以及
973.现在这些人在这里都困扰着
974箱所以我们说，我想要的目标的一个
975的，并改变图像的内部
976.还有我也是在同一时间将
977告诉你如何SAS使得它很容易
从你的图片文件夹，978抓取图像没有
979.不管他们在哪里，所以你不会有
980.所以我想用真正的长名字
981.目标的图像和我想要的目标的
982形象与这个特定的ALT
983编程框架你去那里和
984，如果我想改变我的内容
985将改变这里面图像
的有986，我去
987的内容图像和图像- URL，然后
988无论它的名字是我的内部
989 。图片文件夹，所以图像点鹏是什么
990是分号和右像，这
991直接加载它里面有那么
992.很整洁这是非常美国 eful有
993一切都建立了这样的就像我说的
994在这里，你可能有点点向前
995斜线，你可能有一个前向
996斜杠这将取决于你要
997到也来试试吧然后解决它，做
998这
999使其工作以及它是没有意义的
1000为了这个，我也能有这样的
1001自动获得任何的尺寸
1002是这样的话，如果我说的宽度，我想到
1003让我的图片的宽度，我可以这样做，我
1004也可能只是让我的图像高度
1005粘贴那些内看到这使我
1006不必这样做，但无论哪种方式，
1007是什么，这是要干什么是它会
1008告诉我什么图像的宽度和
1009高度的实际图像，然后
1010店它有它会使其
1011增长非常大，看上去有点难看，但
1012无论我只是想表明你
1013.这是非常有用的，在这种情况下
1014这不是有用的，但很多时候在其它
1015环境中，所以我想是非常有用的
1016套塔 牛逼另一件事情，我们能做的就是
1017了一些东西整洁，我们可以
1018的规模和移动上的不同元素
水平和垂直1019的屏幕采用
1020的指南针，所以它会像跨
1021浏览器或东西类型那将
1022自动生成所以我们说
1023，我想利用这个小标志
1024，我有在这里，我想规模
1025它，我想将它移动到右边
的1026方屏幕有多难，为
1027做好我只是去小去定位我的
1028徽标，然后@include规模，让
1029说，我想增加它的两倍
1030大小水平和垂直方向有
1031你去那所有花费做到这一点，
1032也我可以进来，让我们做一个
1033的变换，让我们将它在
1034 x方向700个像素，你会去
1035变换转换X 700个像素权
1036这样的，然后让我们说，我想
1037翻译Ÿ10个像素，在那里，我们去
1038做一个又一个 让我们说，我们也是
1039要扩展它，我可以把规模
1040的位置，将工作以及内部
1041，让我们说，我也想旋转
1042它的负45度，这是多么
1043辛苦，是做把
1044分号那里，所以你把一切
1045所有有一行并且只是做
1046无论你需要做的，你可以看到
1047.这是在这里，它是关闭的页面和
1048它的，但它旋转时，它是
1049一切，所以才开这个东西
1050我的头了这里的很大一部分
1051，并得到愚蠢的事情，但一点点的
1052无论哪种方式，你会得到一个什么样的要点
1053对那里这是它在屏幕上的
1054在其一侧，它的旋转和所有
1055本其他不同的东西好了，什么
1056还能做什么以及我们可以使用指南针
1057把一个阴影在我们所有的文本
1058。里面让我们说这个段落标记
1059.这里，在这种情况下是要
1060是这里面的第二个孩子元素 的
1061有那么一次，我们得到的文章和我
1062希望有一个段落标记和我想要的
1063第九届或者我想要得到的第二个孩子
1064元，如果我希望把一些文字
1065.阴影我可以去过滤阴影
1066年，让我们说，我想提出一个灰色的
1067，让我们做一个横向偏移一个
1068像素一个像素垂直和我们有
1069去确保这是孩子不超
1070重载它有你可以看到的是一个
阴影的1071点点的内部
1072有让我们使这个有点
1073.强，有我们改变
1074模糊量两个像素，有你
1075可以看到这就是模糊在那里有
1076滤镜效果，我们还可以使用
1077指南针另一件事是整洁是我们
1078年可以根据改变不同的属性
1079关的条件，从而让我们定义这
1080只是一个普通的可变我要去
1081.称之为谜颜色，这是我们
1082定义的，以及我们如何使用条件
1083如果L 等我们只使用，如果在这里声明
1084。
1096这里，所以这是我们如何使用，如果和
1097 else语句基于改变的事情，
1098关几乎任何类型的条件的
1099，但有一个条件，其中值
这个变量的1100是灰色的，如果我们
1101 ，将其更改为下面就让我们做
1102，我们重新加载它，现在它的下面还行
1103所以它仍然可以正常工作的事情，我们可以
1104做的是有使用for循环的选择
1105内部SAS的
1106让我们去中国2％的黄色和什么我们
1107要做的是我们要上色
这儿1108这些人在该导航
1109日益增长的黄色值，所以我们的
1110出发的黄是个
1111将是5％，你可以用你百分之
1112可以使用，你可以使用任何的数字如何
，我们1113使用for循环在4I从去
1114，然后让我们来定义我们想要的东西，所以我们
1115有这些家伙414所以我们要
1116说1到14这就是多久我们对
1117环是要执行的，然后如果我们
1118想改变 这一点，我们只是颜色
1119去VERT包围所有的资产净值
在我们的左侧边栏导航1120项
1121谈论这个家伙就在这里
1122和UL和李，我们要为
1123的定位列表项目
1124。所以我们说，9日的孩子，然后，如果我们
1125要放一些在这里我们里面
1126已经把数字符号一样，和
1127这些支架，然后我所以这将
1128进行排序，通过和它会循环
1129.通过这些它是一个每个人
1130最酷的东西确定，然后如果我们
1131要改变背景颜色为
1132的它会周期的每一个
通过他们每个人的1133，让我们说我们
1134想混黄，我们想混
1135白色，然后我们在黄量
1136希望把这里内部将
1137是黄色％一样，我们的变量，我们
1138定义，然后外在此之后
1139我们退出循环少，我们可以去％的
1140黄色而这将是等于
1141％的黄 加上5％，你
1142可以说我会不断增加值
在5％的黄色1143.说开始了
1144千里迢迢高达百分之百
1145我喜欢我们还有什么可以做一个
1146另一件事这太酷了，我们是可以
1147使用指南针和拼合基本上
1148什么它会做的是它会
1149结合了一大堆图片，我们的
1150提供了一个文件夹，并且它要
1151把它们转换成一个图像是
1152会限制我们的服务器任务所以
1153年我们做图像的那个文件夹里面你
1154可以在这里看到我的图标，这里是所有
1155这些图标是什么回事要做的就是
1156这将采取所有这些，它的
1157将在一个图像来创建它们所有的
1158和它会自动将
1159提供适当的背景图像
的每个的1160定义和位置
在精灵1161元让我们说
1162 。听起来好像很多工作让我们在
1163，并告诉你这是多么便捷的S Ø
1164年第一关我们需要导入的能力
与精灵的工作1165.所以我们会去进口
1166，这应该是在顶部
1167的屏幕，但我只是想保持
1168这里的一切都在一个地方所以
1169公用事业和精灵这样那么如果
1170我们要进口那些我们去图片
1171进口和我们定义的任何文件夹
1172的名字是它是图标，然后我们
1173去的明星以为他们是所有的ping文件
1174和这只适用于平文件，
1175据我所知，然后我们将
1176说包括所有图标精灵这样的
1177，现在我们就可以做的是
1178。针对我中有你没有看到他们在这里对
1179的屏幕，但如果我们在这里走在等待
1180的屏幕下方可以看到正确的
1181.在这里看到我有一个类称为图标和
1182一大堆内这些div
1183这里与特定的类名，所以我
1184可以回来在这里，我可以只
1185转到图标靶向然后时钟应用
1186和 N到它列入我只是去包括
1187图标雪碧和时钟，然后做这个
1188的所有其他图标，然后我就可以去
1189图标和div中一切
1190和定义的高度，我只是在做
1191这所以一切显示了对
1192的屏幕，你可以使用这些无论你
1193要64个像素，并重新加载它，有
1194，你可以看到这一切的精灵现身
1195的内部有什么也很酷是
1196.我们可以打开这件事和风格-所有
1197正在生成这个东西，你
1198年可以看到所有的背景位置
1199.我们所有的不同的项目是要
1200来为我们自动生成所以看到
1201图标有一个时钟上的日记是
1202和各个背景位置
1203的所以他们都在一个图像
1204自动创建它们，你
1205可以看到所有的东西就在那里那么
1206很酷，然后我最后一件事
1207要做的是我要去勾搭
1208这个丑陋表日 在羽绒在这里看到
1209有这个表，我要告诉你
1210如何清理一下使它看起来一个
指南针1211更好一点和我们
1212会说进口和指南针
再次1213公用事业和表格就是这
1214人居住和这个名字是
1215棒球统计，我们要以
1216专门针对我们的表，我们使用
1217一些所谓的脚手架表咱们
1218包括表脚手架和我们
1219。通过去找到我们的内部边界
1220包括这是别的东西你们
1221可以用不同的颜色和播放
1222的东西，那是我们的边界和
1223的边界，让我们只是让这四款
1224像素，让我们定义表颜色
1225如表颜色它是一个变量，我想我
1226保存在这里，我想我没那么
1227年，让我们去把这里这个权利
1228台的颜色，让我们只是使它黑色
1229只是为了保持它的简单，所以有表
1230色分号有那么那将
1231定义INNE R表边界和我们
1232还可以定义我们的外表格边框
1233外，让我们保持这个简单的
1234让我们把这个杜克大学蓝还有我们是
1235，然后我们可以处理表分拆为
1236以及包括交替行和列
1237，让我们说，我希望我的连排
1238的颜色是蓝色的爱丽丝和我的奇数行
1239的颜色是灰白色的交点
1240那些让我们只让这个表色
1241，然后让我们说，我希望我的头
1242色为白色
1243保存该重新加载它在那里你可以
1244爱丽丝说，蓝色和灰色，所有的
1245表头总是那么在这里你去
1246人有一吨的不同的事情
1247你可以用青菜以及指南针做
1248希望你们喜欢这个教程
